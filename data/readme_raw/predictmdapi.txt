PredictMDAPI The PredictMDAPI package provides the abstract types, traits, and functions that define the PredictMD application programming interface (API). This is a very lightweight package. It has no dependencies. The only lines of code are: Abstract types, i.e. abstract type Foo end Immutable composite types with no fields, i.e. struct Bar <: Foo end Function stubs, i.e. function hello end
