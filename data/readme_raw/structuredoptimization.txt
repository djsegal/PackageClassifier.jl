StructuredOptimization.jl StructuredOptimization.jl is a high-level modeling language that utilizes a syntax that is very close to the mathematical formulation of an optimization problem. This user-friendly interface acts as a parser to utilize three different packages: ProximalOperators.jl AbstractOperators.jl ProximalAlgorithms.jl StructuredOptimization.jl can handle large-scale convex and nonconvex problems with nonsmooth cost functions. It supports complex variables as well. Installation To install the package, hit ] from the Julia command line to enter the package manager, then pkg > add StructuredOptimization Usage A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) can be solved with only few lines of code: julia > using StructuredOptimization julia > n, m = 100 , 10 ; # define problem size julia > A, y = randn (m,n), randn (m); # random problem data julia > x = Variable (n); # initialize optimization variable julia > λ = 1e-2 * norm (A ' * y, Inf ); # define λ julia > @minimize ls ( A * x - y ) + λ * norm (x, 1 ); # solve problem julia > ~ x # inspect solution 100 - element Array{Float64, 1 } : 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.440254 0.0 0.0 0.0 [ ... ] See the documentation for more details about the type of problems StructuredOptimization.jl can handle and the demos to check out some examples.
