TreeView This is a small package to visualize a graph corresponding to an abstract syntax tree (AST) of a Julia expression. It uses the TikzGraphs.jl package to do the visualization. Usage The package is designed to be used within the IJulia notebook. The simplest usage is @tree <EXPRESSION> , where <EXPRESSION> represents any Julia expression, for example @tree x^2 + y^2 which gives the following output: See this notebook for usage examples. Installation prerequisites You will need to have LaTeX installed on your system, and install the pdf2svg utility; see the TikzGraphs.jl documentation for details. Author David P.
