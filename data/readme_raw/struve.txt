Struve.jl This package provides methods to compute the Struve functions H, K, L, and M. The default methods currently use integral representations of the functions which are computed numerically using QuadGK.jl and SpecialFunctions.jl . It also implements fast approximations for H₀ and H₁ on the real axis (with absolute error below 2×10⁻³). For fast, high accuracy approximations ApproxFun.jl may be used. Note that methods are not exported; instead they can be accessed via dot-syntax, e.g. Struve.K0(z) . The currently available methods are: Struve.H(ν, z) Struve.K(ν, z) Struve.L(ν, z) Struve.M(ν, z) Struve.H0(z) Struve.K0(z) Struve.L0(z) Struve.M0(z) Struve.H0_fast(x) Struve.H1_fast(x) Please note: Implementations have not been systematically verified yet; bug reports and test cases are welcome.
