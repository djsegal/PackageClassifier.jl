PhyloModels.jl PhyloModels.jl is a package for performing genetic sequence simulation from specified phylogenetic trees (using PhyloTrees.jl for phylogenetic tree specification, and SubstitutionModels.jl for nucleic acid substitution model specification), and for loglikelihood calculation of phylogenetic trees using Felsenstein's tree pruning algorithm¹. ¹ Felsenstein, J. (1981). Evolutionary trees from DNA sequences: a maximum likelihood approach. Journal of molecular evolution, 17 (6), 368-376. Installation The current release can be installed from the Julia REPL: pkg > add PhyloModels The development version (master branch) can be installed as: pkg > add PhyloModels # master
