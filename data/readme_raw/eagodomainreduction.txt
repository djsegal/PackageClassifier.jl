EAGODomainReduction.jl Domain Reduction Procedures in Global Optimization Authors Matthew Wilhelm , Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Connecticut (UCONN) Installation julia > Pkg . add ( " EAGODomainReduction.jl " ) Capabilities EAGODomainReduction.jl provides a series of subroutines for tightening the domains of subproblems solved in global optimization (potentially to in-feasibility). Currently, it supports routines for nonconvex nonlinear programs: Interval Contractor Propagation: A forward-backward interval contractor using IntervalArthimetic.jl and IntervalContractors.jl for the operator library. Duality-Based Bound Tightening: Provides algorithms for tightening domains based on duality of solutions found for subproblems. Standard Range Reduction: Contracts subproblem domain via linear-relaxations generated using McCormick relaxations. Implicit Subroutine support: Supports domain reduction of reduced space lower-bound problems defined through relaxation of implicit functions by fixed-point methods. The routine are used extensively in the EAGO.jl package solver. Please see the example files for usage cases. Future Work Update the interval-constraint propagation algorithm to incorporate propagation heuristics in Vu2008. Incorporate control-flow syntax support into constraint propagation algorithm. Incorporate improvements to probing and optimality based-bound tightening. Add support for Mixed-Integer NLP. Related Packages EAGO.jl : A package containing global and robust solvers based mainly on McCormick relaxations. This package supports a JuMP and MathProgBase interface. IntervalConstraintProgramming.jl : Provides algorithms that furnish bounds on constraints defined by expressions. The constraint propagation routine in EAGODomainReduction.jl can generate tape objects that are reusable for generically-defined functions. In addition, we use a Vector{Interval} storage object that allows for in-place mutation of intervals. IntervalContractors.jl : Provides a library of reverse interval contractors.
