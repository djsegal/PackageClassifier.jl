Displaz Bindings for the displaz lidar viewer for flexible three dimensional plotting of large point clouds, lines and meshes. Installation Check the installation instructions at displaz's repository. Then install Displaz.jl using the REPL Pkg mode: (v1 .0 ) pkg > add Displaz Quickstart To plot a point cloud of 10⁵ points, where every point position is a column in a matrix: using Displaz plot3d! ( 10 * randn ( 3 , 100000 )) To plot a point cloud of 10⁶ points with random orange and red HSV colors: using Displaz using Colors N = 1000_000 position = 10 * randn ( 3 ,N) color = [ HSV ( 80 * rand (), 0.8 , 1 ) for i = 1 : N] plot3d! (position, color = color, label = " Example2 " ) To plot a set of 5 vertices, and line series between a subset of these vertices: using Displaz using Colors using StaticArrays # Clear plots clearplot () N = 5 # Random points position = rand (SVector{ 3 ,Float64}, N) # Plot points plot3d! (position, color = [ Gray {Float64} (i / N) for i = 1 : N], label = " Example3 Points " ) # Plot a pair of line series between vertices 1:2 and 3:5 plot3d! (position, color = " r " , linebreak = [ 1 , 3 ], markershape = " - " , label = " Example3 Lines " ) # mutate the color of the first two points (efficient for modifying a subset of points) Displaz . mutate! ( " Example3 Points " , 1 : 2 ; color = [ Gray {Float64} ( 1.0 )])
