The PeaceFounder.jl is aiming to be a universal swiss knife for community maintainers. It aims to be the module from which communities take first the backend methods for the server and second the frontend methods defining how members register, propose, vote and braid. This package is successful if every line which you write for the community represents a political decision. A declarative API is a goal.
