Hyperbolic Plane The HyperbolicPlane module provides basic objects (such as points, segments, rays, lines, polygons, and circles) in the Hyperbolic plane and visualization in the Poincaré Disc. Documentation is in the Wiki . Also see the examples . The drawing functions rely on SimpleDrawing (a modest extension of Plots ). We also require these modules: LinearFractionalTransformations : provides Möbius transformations. AbstractLattices : Defines ∨ and ∧ .
