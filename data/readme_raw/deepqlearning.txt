DeepQLearning.jl Julia implementation of DeepMind's Deep Q-Learning algorithm as described in Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning . This code only implements the base algorithm. It does not include the code for a convolutional network. However, this can be easily added using Mocha.jl. In lieu of this it uses a simpler single layer neural network. Information on the original RecurrenJS DQN implementation can be found here note: This library has been tested on various learning tasks and seems to be functioning correctly, but is not yet ready for public consumption. Example code using DeepQLearning ... coming soon ... I hope :) ##Dependencies This library requires NNGraph.jl . ##Credits This library draws on the work of Andrej Karpathy License MIT
