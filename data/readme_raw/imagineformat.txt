ImagineFormat Imagine is an acquisition program for light sheet microscopy written by Zhongsheng Guo in Tim Holy's lab. This package implements a loader for the file format for the Julia programming language. Each Imagine "file" consists of two parts (as two separate files): a *.imagine file which contains the (ASCII) header, and a *.cam file which contains the camera data. The *.cam file is a raw byte dump, and is compatible with the NRRD "raw" file. Usage Read Imagine files like this: using Images img = load ( " filename " ) Converting to NRRD You can write an NRRD header ( *.nhdr ) from an Imagine header as follows: h = ImagineFormat . parse_header (filename) # the .imagine file name imagine2nrrd (nrrdname, h, datafilename) where datafilename is the name of the *.cam file. It is required by the *.nhdr file to point to the actual data. Writing Imagine headers You can use the non-exported function ImagineFormat.save_header : save_header (destname, srcname, img, [T]) destname is the output *.imagine file; srcname is the name of the "template" file. Certain header values (e.g., size information) are updated by reference to img . The optional argument T allows you to specify a different element type than possessed by img .
