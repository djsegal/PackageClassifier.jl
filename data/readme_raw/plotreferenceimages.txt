PlotReferenceImages This package serves two purposes. It holds the reference images for the Plots.jl test suite and it provides utilities to generate the images for the Plots.jl documentation at PlotDocs.jl Installation To update test reference images for Plots.jl you can develop this package with: julia > ] pkg > dev https : // github . com / JuliaPlots / PlotReferenceImages . jl . git Usage Plots test images can be updated with the Plots test suite: julia > ] pkg > test Plots If reference images differ from the previously saved images, a window opens showing both versions. Check carefully if the changes are expected and an improvement. In that case agree to overwrite the old image. Otherwise it would be great if you could open an issue on Plots.jl, submit a PR with a fix for the regression or update the PR you are currently working on. After updating all the images, make sure that all tests pass, git add the new files, commit and submit a PR. You can update the images for a specific backend in the backends section of the Plots documentation with: using PlotReferenceImages generate_reference_images (sym) Currently sym âˆˆ (:gr, :pyplot, :plotlyjs, :pgfplots) is supported. To update only a single image you can do: generate_reference_image (sym, i :: Int ) To update the Plots documentaion images run: using PlotReferenceImages generate_doc_images () This takes some time. So if you only want to update a specific image, run: generate_doc_image (id :: String ) Possible values for id can be found in the keys of PlotReferenceImages.DOC_IMAGE_FILES . If you are satisfied with the new images, commit and submit a PR. Contributing Any help to make these processes less complicated or automate them is very much appreciated.
