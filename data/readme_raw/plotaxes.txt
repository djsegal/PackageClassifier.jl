PlotAxes PlotAxes is intended to simplify the visualization of medium dimensional data (e.g. 4-5 dimensions max) during an interactive session. It is not intended as a full fledged plotting API for publication quality graphs. It can be used to plot an AbstractArray or AxisArray . Supported backends are described in the documentation of PlotAxes.list_backends . With an AxisArray the axes will be properly labeled. To use it, just call plotaxes , as follows. using PlotAxes, AxisArrays, Gadfly # replace Gadfly with VegaLite or RCall as desired plotaxes ( AxisArray ( rand ( 10 , 10 , 4 , 2 ), :time , :freq , :age , :gender )) This code results in the following figure: For more details, see the documentation for plotaxes (ala ? at the REPL). Status This is working for display of data in my day-to-day work. It has a fairly minimal number of features, as it intended for my initial, rapid plotting, and I employ a specific backend for more detailed, publication quality figures. There are plenty of features that might be added or backends that could be implemented. In the long-term I would like to make the plotaxes command easily composable with the other features of each backend.
