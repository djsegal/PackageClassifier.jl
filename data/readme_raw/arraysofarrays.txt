ArraysOfArrays.jl A Julia package for efficient storage and handling of nested arrays. ArraysOfArrays provides two different types of nested arrays: ArrayOfSimilarArrays and VectorOfArrays . An ArrayOfSimilarArrays offers a duality of view between representing the same data as both a flat multi-dimensional array and as an array of equally-sized arrays. A VectorOfArrays represents a vector of arrays of equal dimensionality but different size. Internally, both types store their data in flat arrays that are accessible to the user flatview() .
