ProjectiveVectors.jl Documentation Build Status Data structure for elements in products of projective spaces. This package defines as type PVector{T,N} where T is the element type and N is the number of projective spaces in which the vector lives. julia > using ProjectiveVectors, LinearAlgebra # We want to consider the vector [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] as a vector [1:2:3]×[4:5:6] in P²×P² julia > PVector ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ], ( 2 , 2 )) [ 1 : 2 : 3 ] × [ 4 : 5 : 6 ] # We also can embed an affine vector into a projective space. # Here we embed [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] into P²×P³×P¹ julia > v = embed ([ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ], ( 2 , 3 , 1 )) [ 2 : 3 : 1 ] × [ 4 : 5 : 6 : 1 ] × [ 7 : 1 ] # We support several linear algebra routines.
