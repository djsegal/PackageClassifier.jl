SeisNoise.jl SeisNoise.jl is designed for fast and easy ambient noise cross-correlation in Julia. Installation From the Julia command prompt: Press ] to enter pkg . Type or copy: add SeisNoise Press backspace to exit pkg . Type or copy: using SeisNoise Package Features Built upon SeisIO for easy and fast I/O. Custom types for saving Fourier Transforms of data and cross-correlations Array-based processing of raw data and cross-correlation. Methods for dv/v measurements. Coming soon: GPU support and dispersion analysis. Basic Cross-Correlation Once you have installed the package you can type using SeisNoise to start cross-correlating. For example using SeisNoise, SeisIO fs = 40. # sampling frequency in Hz freqmin,freqmax = 0.1 , 0.2 # min and max frequencies cc_step, cc_len = 450 , 1800 # corrleation step and length in S maxlag = 60. # maximum lag time in correlation s = " 2019-02-03 " t = " 2019-02-04 " S1 = get_data ( " FDSN " , " CI.SDD..BHZ " ,src = " SCEDC " ,s = s,t = t) S2 = get_data ( " FDSN " , " CI.PER..BHZ " ,src = " SCEDC " ,s = s,t = t) process_raw! (S1,fs) process_raw! (S2,fs) R = RawData .([S1,S2],cc_len,cc_step) detrend! .(R) taper! .(R) bandpass! .(R,freqmin,freqmax,zerophase = true ) FFT = compute_fft .(R) whiten! .(FFT,freqmin,freqmax) C = compute_cc (FFT[ 1 ],FFT[ 2 ],maxlag) clean_up! (C,freqmin,freqmax) abs_max! (C) corrplot (C) will produce this figure:
