QuantumWalk Description QuantumWalk.jl is a package for Julia programming language implementing models of quantum continuous and discrete walks used for performing quantum spatial search. It's main purpose is to provide general functionalities by crossing usage of quantum models and applications implementations. Currently the package provides implementation of Szegedy quantum walks Szegedy with abstract supertype AbstractSzegedy , continuous-time quantum walks CTQW and CTQWDense with abstract supertype AbstractCTQW , and dynamics simple quantum walk QWEvolution , quantum spatial search QWSearch . In particular for the last dynamic algorithm maximize_quantum_search finding optimal measure time are implemeneted. Note the function works in general for arbitrary discrete-time quantum walk. The results are not guaranteed for continuous-time quantum walk, as times is not discretized. Installation The package can be installed using Pkg.clone command as (v1.0) pkg> add QuantumWalk All of the required modules will be installed automatically.
