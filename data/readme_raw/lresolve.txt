LRESolve.jl Solving Systems of Linear Rational Expectations Equations in Julia Installation These commands install the latest version of LRESolve.jl import Pkg; Pkg.add("https://github.com/NormannR/LRESolve.jl.git") import Pkg; Pkg.add("LRESolve.jl") Methods Sims (2001) Sims (2001) solves LRE systems of the form where x is the vector of endogenous variables z is the vector of exogenous shocks η is the vector of expectation errors The solution verifies To solve a LRE system using this method Define the model through the ModelSims structure. The syntax is typically M0 = ModelSims (Γ₀,Γ₁,C,Ψ,Π) Call the solve_sims method over the newly created model Θ, Θ₀, Θ₁ = solve_sims (M0) Uhlig (1998) Uhlig (1998) solves LRE systems of the form where x is the vector of endogenous variables f is the vector of exogenous variables The solution takes the form To solve a LRE system using this method Define the model through the ModelUhlig structure. The syntax is typically M0 = ModelUhlig (F,G,H,L,M,N) Call the solve_uhlig method over the newly created model P,Q = solve_uhlig (M0) Anderson and Moore (1985) Anderson and Moore (1985) solves systems of the form where x is the vector of all variables τ is the number of past lags θ is the number of future lags The solution is of the form To solve a system using this method Define the model through the ModelAM structure. The syntax is typically M0 = ModelAM (τ,θ,[Hmτ, ... ,Hθ]) Call the solve_am method over the newly created model B = solve_am (M0) The different methods can be tested using Binder.
