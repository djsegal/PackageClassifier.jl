Lasso Documentation Build Status Lasso.jl is a pure Julia implementation of the glmnet coordinate descent algorithm for fitting linear and generalized linear Lasso and Elastic Net models, as described in: Friedman, J., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2010). Regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent. Journal of Statistical Software, 33(1), 1. http://www.jstatsoft.org/v33/i01/ Lasso.jl also includes an implementation of the O(n) fused Lasso implementation described in: Johnson, N. A. (2013). A dynamic programming algorithm for the fused lasso and L0-segmentation. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 22(2), 246–260. doi:10.1080/10618600.2012.681238 As well as an implementation of polynomial trend filtering based on: Ramdas, A., & Tibshirani, R. J. (2014). Fast and flexible ADMM algorithms for trend filtering. arXiv Preprint arXiv:1406.2082. Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2082 Also implements the Gamma Lasso, a concave regularization path glmnet variant: Taddy, M. (2017) One-Step Estimator Paths for Concave Regularization Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 26:3, 525-536 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2016.1211532 Quick start To fit a Lasso path with default parameters: fit (LassoPath, X, y, dist, link) dist is any distribution supported by GLM.jl and link defaults to the canonical link for that distribution. To fit a fused Lasso model: fit (FusedLasso, y, λ) To fit a polynomial trend filtering model: fit (TrendFilter, y, order, λ) To fit a Gamma Lasso path: fit (GammaLassoPath, X, y, dist, link; γ = 1.0 ) It supports the same parameters as fit(LassoPath...), plus γ which controls the concavity of the regularization path. γ=0.0 is the Lasso. Higher values tend to result in sparser coefficient estimates. More documentation is available at .
