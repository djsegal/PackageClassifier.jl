Indicators Indicators is a Julia package offering efficient implementations of many technical analysis indicators and algorithms. This work is inspired by the TTR package in R and the Python implementation of TA-Lib , and the ultimate goal is to implement all of the functionality of these offerings (and more) in Julia. This package has been written to be able to interface with both native Julia Array types, as well as the TS time series type from the Temporal package. Contributions are of course always welcome for wrapping any of these functions in methods for other types and/or packages out there, as are suggestions for other indicators to add to the lists below. Implemented Moving Averages SMA (simple moving average) WMA (weighted moving average) EMA (exponential moving average) TRIMA (triangular moving average) KAMA (Kaufman adaptive moving average) MAMA (MESA adaptive moving average, developed by John Ehlers) HMA (Hull moving average) ALMA (Arnaud-Legoux moving average) SWMA (sine-weighted moving average) DEMA (double exponential moving average) TEMA (triple exponential moving average) ZLEMA (zero-lag exponential moving average) MMA (modified moving average) MLR (moving linear regression) Prediction Slope Intercept Standard error Upper & lower bound R-squared Momentum Indicators Momentum (n-day price change) ROC (rate of change) MACD (moving average convergence-divergence) RSI (relative strength index) ADX (average directional index) Parabolic SAR (stop and reverse) Fast & slow stochastics SMI (stochastic momentum indicator) KST (Know Sure Thing) Williams %R CCI (commodity channel index) Donchian channel Aroon indicator + oscillator Volatility Indicators Bollinger Bands Average True Range Keltner Bands Other Rolling/running mean Rolling/running standard deviation Rolling/running variance Rolling/running covariance Rolling/running correlation Rolling/running maximum Rolling/running minimum Rolling/running MAD (mean absolute deviation) Rolling/running quantiles Todo Moving Linear Regression KAMA (Kaufman adaptive moving average) DEMA (double exponential moving average) TEMA (tripe exponential moving average) ALMA (Arnaud Legoux moving average) Parabolic SAR Williams %R KST (know sure thing) CCI (commodity channel index) ROC (rate of change) Momentum Donchian Channel Aroon Indicator / Aroon Oscillator Stochastics Slow Stochastics Fast Stochastics Stochastic Momentum Index MMA (modified moving average) ZLEMA (zero lag exponential moving average) Hamming moving average VWMA (volume-weighted moving average) VWAP (volume-weighted average price) EVWMA (elastic, volume-weighted moving average) VMA (variable-length moving average) Chaikin Money Flow Ultimate Oscillator OBV (on-balance volume) Too many more to name...always happy to hear suggestions though!
