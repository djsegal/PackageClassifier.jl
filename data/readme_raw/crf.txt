CRF.jl The CRF package implements linear-chain Conditional Random Fields. CRFs are a probabilistic framework for labeling sequential data. Quickstart julia > using CRF julia > crf = Sequence (x, y, features) julia > loglikelihood (crf) julia > loglikelihood_gradient (crf) julia > label (crf) The example directory contains a detailed documentation.
