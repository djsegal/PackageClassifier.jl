EnhancedLogging.jl Extends and improves the Julia language's built in ConsoleLogger . Additionally adds a WorkerLogger that passes log records to the main process before processing them. Install pkg > add EnhancedLogging Usage To setup enhanced logging on all running processes, put the following after all worker processes have been started: @everywhere using Logging, EnhancedLogging global_logger ( EnhancedConsoleLogger ()) @everywhere global_logger ( WorkerLogger ( global_logger ())) This will setup an EnhancedLogger on the master process, and WorkerLogger s on the workers. Limitations Currently, the worker logging only works with global loggers, i.e. using with_logger will prevent the log message from being forwarded to the master process. This is mostly due to a limitation in how pointers are serialized for interprocess communication. If you have ideas about how to circumvent this problem, please open an issue so that we can discuss.
