InplaceOps.jl InplaceOps.jl is a Julia package that provides macros that enable a simple syntax for performing in-place (i.e. overwriting) array operations using standard arithmetic operators. Usage InplaceOps.jl provides a macro @! which rewrites expressions of the form: C = A*B to mul!(C,A,B) C = C*B or C *= B to rmul!(C,B) C = A*C to lmul!(A,B) C = A/B to rdiv!(C,A,B) C = C/B or C /= B to rdiv!(C,B) C = A\B to ldiv!(C,A,B) C = A\C to ldiv!(A,B) Functionality for broadcasting is no longer supported. Use the Base @. macro instead. Example julia > using LinearAlgebra, InplaceOps julia > T = UpperTriangular ( ones ( 5 , 5 )) 5 × 5 UpperTriangular{Float64,Array{Float64, 2 }} : 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 ⋅ 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 ⋅ ⋅ 1.0 1.0 1.0 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 1.0 1.0 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 1.0 julia > x_orig = x = [ 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 ] 5 - element Array{Float64, 1 } : 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 julia > @ ! x = T \ x 5 - element Array{Float64, 1 } : - 1.0 - 1.0 - 1.0 - 1.0 5.0 julia > x === x_orig true
