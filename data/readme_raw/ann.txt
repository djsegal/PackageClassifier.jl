julia-ann Implementation of backpropagation artificial neural networks in Julia. Install (from within Julia interpreter): Pkg . clone ( " git@github.com:EricChiang/ANN.jl.git " ) Usage: using ANN n_hidden_units = 20 ann = ArtificialNeuralNetwork (n_hidden_units) n_obs = 150 n_feats = 80 X = rand (Float64, n_obs, n_feats) y = rand (Int64, n_obs) fit! (ann, X, y) n_new_obs = 60 X_new = rand (Float64, n_new_obs, n_feats) y_pred = predict (ann, X_new) TODO: Allow users to build multilayer networks Accept DataFrames as inputs. fit! and predict currently require Float64 matrices and vectors.
