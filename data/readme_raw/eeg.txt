Example Plot single and multi channel data using EEG s = read_SSR ( " file.bdf " ) s = highpass_filter (s) s = rereference (s, " Cz " ) s = trim_channel (s, 8192 * 80 , start = 8192 * 50 ) plot_timeseries (s, channels = " P6 " ) plot_timeseries (s) Plot estimated neural activity If you have source activity saved in a *.dat file (eg BESA) you can plot the estimated activity and local peaks of activity. using EEG t = read_VolumeImage ( " example.dat " ) p = EEG . plot (t, c = :darkrainbow ) p = EEG . plot (t, find_dipoles (t), l = " Peak Activity " , c = :black )
