BlockBandedMatrices.jl A Julia package for representing block-block-banded matrices and banded-block-banded matrices This package supports representing block-banded and banded-block-banded matrices by only storing the entries in the non-zero bands. A BlockBandedMatrix is a subtype of BlockMatrix of BlockArrays.jl whose non-zero blocks are banded. We can construct a BlockBandedMatrix as follows: l,u = 2 , 1 # block bandwidths N = M = 4 # number of row/column blocks cols = rows = 1 : N # block sizes BlockBandedMatrix ( Zeros ( sum (rows), sum (cols)), rows,cols, (l,u)) # creates a block-banded matrix of zeros BlockBandedMatrix ( Ones ( sum (rows), sum (cols)), rows,cols, (l,u)) # creates a block-banded matrix with ones in the non-zero entries BlockBandedMatrix (I, rows,cols, (l,u)) # creates a block-banded identity matrix A BandedBlockBandedMatrix has the added structure that the blocks themselves are banded, and conform to the banded matrix interface of BandedMatrices.jl . We can construct a BandedBlockBandedMatrix as follows: l,u = 2 , 1 # block bandwidths λ,μ = 1 , 2 # sub-block bandwidths: the bandwidths of each block N = M = 4 # number of row/column blocks cols = rows = 1 : N # block sizes BandedBlockBandedMatrix ( Zeros ( sum (rows), sum (cols)), rows,cols, (l,u), (λ,μ)) # creates a banded-block-banded matrix of zeros BandedBlockBandedMatrix ( Ones ( sum (rows), sum (cols)), rows,cols, (l,u), (λ,μ)) # creates a banded-block-banded matrix with ones in the non-zero entries BandedBlockBandedMatrix (I, rows,cols, (l,u), (λ,μ))) # creates a banded-block-banded identity matrix
