Zabbix.jl Julia bindings for Zabbix API 🔥 The package has been tested over version 3.2.11 . Installation Since Zabbix is registered in METADATA.jl , you can directly install it like, julia > Pkg . add ( " Zabbix " ) Update julia > Pkg . update ( " Zabbix " ) How it works? Please make sure that you have a valid Zabbix URL available along with the right access levels. In case you have only read access on the zabbix server, you may not be able to use configuration and management operations. Full read & write access is desired. Creating a ZabbixAPI instance julia > zabbix = Zabbix . ZabbixAPI ( " http://SERVER_IP/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php " , " USERNAME " , " ****** " , false ) Zabbix . ZabbixAPI ( " http://SERVER_IP/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php " , " USERNAME " , " ****** " , false , 0 , Dict ( " Content-Type " => " application/json-rpc " ), " 2.0 " ) Note that I have set verbose=false . However, by default we have, verbose=true . Hence only set verbose=false if you are okay continuing without the info messages.
