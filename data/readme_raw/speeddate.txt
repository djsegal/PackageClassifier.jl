SpeedDate.jl A simple tool for the estimation of coalescence times between sequences. Created with julia and Bio.jl Documentation A note about unit tests, as SpeedDate essentially wraps Bio.jl functionality in a command line or GTK gui, no unit tests have been included yet, as the functions used have their own unit tests in the BioJulia project in which they are defined. However I intend to test routines and datasets will be included in the near future.
