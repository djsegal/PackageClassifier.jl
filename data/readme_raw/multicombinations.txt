Multicombinations.jl An iterator for k-combinations with repetitions , k-multicombinations, k-multisubsets or whatever you want to call them. Installation Install this package with Pkg.clone("git://github.com/jlep/Multicombinations.jl") Usage multichoose (n, k) Return the number of multisets of length k on n symbols. Examples multichoose ( 3 , 2 ) yields 6 multicombinations (xs, k) Iterate over every k -size multisubset of a collection xs . Example: for i in multicombinations ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ], 2 ) @show i end yields i => [1,1] i => [1,2] i => [1,3] i => [2,2] i => [2,3] i => [3,3] integersums (n, k) Iterate over every nonnegative integer solution of the equation: x 1 + x 2 + ... + x n = k . The order in which the solutions are given corresponds to the order of subsets given by multicombinations(xs, k) . Example: for i in integersums ( 3 , 2 ) @show i end yields i => [2,0,0] i => [1,1,0] i => [1,0,1] i => [0,2,0] i => [0,1,1] i => [0,0,2] is2mc (s) Convert a solution array given by integersums(n, k) to the corresponding multicombination index array. Example: for i in integersums ( 3 , 2 ) @show is2mc (i) end yields is2mc(i) => [1,1] is2mc(i) => [1,2] is2mc(i) => [1,3] is2mc(i) => [2,2] is2mc(i) => [2,3] is2mc(i) => [3,3]
