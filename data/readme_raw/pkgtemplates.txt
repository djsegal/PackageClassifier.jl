NOTICE: This version is not yet released The current stable release is 0.6, you can find that version here . PkgTemplates has undergone large internal changes (see #61 especially), and at present the user-facing API is still catching up. Do not fear, while right now it looks very different (e.g. in the dev docs), it will not be incredibly breaking. But right now if you do use master it will be. PkgTemplates PkgTemplates creates new Julia packages in an easy, repeatable, and customizable way. Installation Install with Pkg, just like any other registered Julia package: pkg > add PkgTemplates # Press ']' to enter te Pkg REPL mode. Usage Creating a Template is as simple as: using PkgTemplates t = Template () The no-keywords constructor assumes the existence of some preexisting Git configuration (set with git config --global ): user.name : Your real name, e.g. John Smith. user.email : Your email address, eg. john.smith@acme.corp . github.user : Your GitHub username: e.g. john-smith. Once you have a Template , use it to generate a package: t ( " MyPkg " ) However, it's probably desirable to customize the template to your liking with various options and plugins: t = Template (; dir = " ~/code " , plugins = [ Git (; manifest = true , ssh = true ), Codecov (), TravisCI (; x86 = true ), Documenter {TravisCI} (), ], ) For a much more detailled overview, please see the documentation.
