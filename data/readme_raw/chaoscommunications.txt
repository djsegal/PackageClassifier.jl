ChaosCommunications The ChaosCommunications package provides a framework for simulating chaos-based communication systems. At the moment the package provides a generic type hierarchy of communication systems and implements the Chaos Shift-Keying (CSK) system. More functionality and systems will be added to the package. An example for simulating CSK and its Bit Error Rate (BER) can be found in examples/UTURUniChannelCSK_example.jl . This example demonstrates the main interface of the package.
