StatProfilerHTML Build Status Test coverage This module formats the output from Julia's Profile module into an html rendering of the source function lines and functions, allowing for interactive exploration of any bottlenecks that may exist in your code. There's two ways of using this: call statprofilehtml() after running the julia profiler in the normal way; or use the @profilehtml macro. Have a look at this example output , which is the result of profiling using StatProfilerHTML using MultivariatePolynomials @polyvar x y z @profilehtml (x + y + z)^120; This module contains a fork of the rendering part of Mattia Barbon and Steffen MÃ¼ller's excellent Devel::StatProfiler , which is a statistical profiler for Perl. It depends on Text::MicroTemplate, which for convenience, we ship as part of this bundle.
