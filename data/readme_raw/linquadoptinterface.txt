LinQuadOptInterface.jl Build Status Social LinQuadOptInterface.jl (LQOI) is designed to provide an intermediate interface to MathOptInterface.jl for some solvers. The target use-cases are low-level wrappers designed to bridge low-level mixed integer linear and quadratic solvers. Examples of packages currently using LQOI include Clp.jl , GLPK.jl , Gurobi.jl , and Xpress.jl . The interface is documented here . Note to solver developers The use of LQOI for MOI wrappers of low-level solvers is entirely optional. Using LQOI introduces an extra abstraction layer between a solver and MOI. We recommend that you carefully analyze the solver's low-level API to check if it is close to what LQOI expects. If a solver low-level API does not support most of the functions required by LQOI, then following the example of SCS.jl and ECOS.jl might be a better idea.
