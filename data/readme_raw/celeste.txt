Celeste.jl Celeste.jl finds and characterizes stars and galaxies in astronomical images. It performs approximate Bayesian inference as described in Jeffrey Regier, Andrew Miller, David Schlegel, Ryan Adams, Jon McAuliffe, and Prabhat. "Approximate inference for constructing astronomical catalogs from images." In: Annals of Applied Statistics, 13 (3), 2019. and Jeffrey Regier, Kiran Pamnany, Keno Fischer, Andreas Noack, Maximilian Lam, Jarrett Revels, Steve Howard, Ryan Giordano, David Schlegel, Jon McAuliffe, Rollin Thomas, and Prabhat. “Cataloging the visible universe through Bayesian inference at petascale.” In: International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS), 2018. and Jeffrey Regier, Andrew Miller, Jon McAuliffe, Ryan Adams, Matt Hoffman, Dustin Lang, David Schlegel, and Prabhat. “Celeste: Variational inference for a generative model of astronomical images.” In: Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) . 2015.
