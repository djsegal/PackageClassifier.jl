ReinforcementLearningEnvironments.jl This package serves as a one-stop place for different kinds of reinforcement learning environments. Install: pkg > add ReinforcementLearningEnvironments API All the environments here are supposed to have implemented the AbstractEnvironment related interfaces in ReinforcementLearningBase.jl . Supported Environments By default, only some basic environments are installed. If you want to use some other environments, you'll need to add those dependencies correspondingly. Built-in Environments CartPoleEnv MountainCarEnv ContinuousMountainCarEnv PendulumEnv 3-rd Party Environments Environment Name Dependent Package Name Description AtariEnv ArcadeLearningEnvironment.jl Tested only on Linux ViZDoomEnv ViZDoom.jl Currently only a basic environment is supported. (By calling basic_ViZDoom_env() ) GymEnv PyCall.jl You need to manually install gym first in Python MDPEnv , POMDPEnv POMDPs.jl The get_observation_space method is undefined OpenSpielEnv OpenSpiel.jl Usage julia > using ReinforcementLearningEnvironments julia > using ReinforcementLearningBase julia > env = CartPoleEnv () CartPoleEnv {Float64} (gravity = 9.8 ,masscart = 1.0 ,masspole = 0.1 ,totalmass = 1.1 ,halflength = 0.5 ,polemasslength = 0.05 ,forcemag = 10.0 ,tau = 0.02 ,thetathreshold = 0.20943951023931953 ,xthreshold = 2.4 ,max_steps = 200 ) julia > action_space = get_action_space (env) DiscreteSpace {UnitRange{Int64}} ( 1 : 2 ) julia > while true action = rand (action_space) env (action) obs = observe (env) get_terminal (obs) && break end
