SubstitutionModels.jl Release status: Development status: Description SubstitutionModels.jl provides facilities to model the substitution process of biological sequences. Such models are essential for the analysis of sequence evolution, phylogenetics, and simulation. We first aim to provide the most common substitution models used in the literature, but aim to build an extendable framework using julia's type system and traits, so as custom model types can be created and used.
