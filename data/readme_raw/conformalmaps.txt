ConformalMaps.jl ConformalMaps is a package for approximating the Riemann map from a simply connected planar domain to a disk. It uses the zipper algorithm as described in Convergence of the zipper algorithm for conformal mapping by Don Marshall and Steffen Rohde. The domain (approximated by a polygon) is specified as an array which lists the vertices of the domain in counterclockwise order. A conformal map from domain to the unit disk which maps center to the origin is initialized as ConformalMap(domain,center) . The keyword argument pointspacing=ϵ inserts equally spaced points along each side of the polygon so that the spacing between consecutive points is everywhere less than ϵ . Smaller values of ϵ give greater accuracy but require longer to compute. The default value is 1% of the diameter of the domain. using AsyPlots, ConformalMaps vertices = [ 1.0 0.0 ; 0.0 1.0 ; - 1.0 0.0 ; 0.0 - 1.0 ] f = ConformalMap (vertices, 0.0 ) f supports function call syntax: f(0.1im) The inverse of f is obtained as inv(f) and is of type InverseConformalMap . If AsyPlots is installed, then visualize may be used to display the images of a hyperbolic tiling of the disk (if called on an InverseConformalMap ) or grid lines (if called on a ConformalMap ). g = inv (f) visualize (g) visualize returns a ConformalMapVisualization object, whose fields domain and range contain AsyPlots.Plot2D objects. combine returns a single plot with the domain and the range
