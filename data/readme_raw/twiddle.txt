Twiddle.jl Description Twiddle is a package collecting useful bit-twiddling tricks, ready to use as functions, with detailed documentation of what they do, and example real-world use cases. This package originated from a PostDoc project where we wanted to do some common biological sequence operations much much faster than a naive implementation could, by taking advantage of succinct bit-encoding of the sequences. This package however is supposed to be more general, and we want it to contain many bit-twiddling tips and tricks. Installation Install Twiddle.jl from the Julia REPL: using Pkg Pkg . add ( " Twiddle " ) If you are interested in the cutting edge of the development, please check out the master branch to try new features before release.
