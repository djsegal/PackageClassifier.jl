StanRun A collection of routines for running CmdStan . Installation This package is registered. Install with pkg > add StanRun You need a working CmdStan installation, the path of which you should specify in JULIA_CMDSTAN_HOME , eg in your ~/.julia/config/startup.jl have a line like # CmdStan setup ENV[ " JULIA_CMDSTAN_HOME " ] = expanduser ( " ~/src/cmdstan-2.19.1/ " ) # replace with your path Usage It is recommended that you start your Julia process with multiple worker processes to take advantage of parallel sampling, eg julia -p auto Otherwise, stan_sample will use a single process. Use this package like this: using StanRun model = StanModel ( " /path/to/model.stan " ) # directory should be writable, for compilation data = (N = 100 , x = randn (N, 1000 )) # in a format supported by stan_dump chains = stan_sample (model, data, 5 ) # 5 chain paths and log files See the docstrings (in particular ?StanRun ) for more.
