Met_Plots_Models The Motivation for this package You might have a feeling of boring when plot a lot of drafty figures(scatters, contourfs ...) with NCL, matlibplot, or other packages, manually configuring longitude, latitude, levels again and again with codes modified little. So I provide a wrapper of matlibplot in Julia to plot a drafty figure with one command, once with configuring longitude and latitude once autonomously and without configuring levels most time.
