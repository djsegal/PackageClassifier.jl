Sigma.jl is currently not under maintainance. Try Omega.jl instead! Sigma Sigma is a probabilistic programming environment implemented in Julia. You can use it to specify probabilistic models as normal Julia programs, and perform inference. Installation Sigma is built on top of Julia. Sigma currently runs on linux only. Sigma is currently highly unstable, beware. Install from a REPL with Pkg . add ( " Sigma " ) Sigma is then loaded with using Sigma Usage Read the documentation , look at the examples , or see the quick start below. Quick Start First we need to include Sigma julia > using Sigma Then, we create a uniform distribution x and draw 100 samples from it using rand : julia > x = uniform ( 0 , 1 ) RandVar{Float64} julia > rand (x, 100 ) 100 - element Array{Float64, 1 } : 0.376264 0.492391 ... Then we can find the probability that x^2 is greater than 0.6: julia > prob (x ^ 2 > 0.6 ) [ 0.225463867187499 0.225463867187499 ] Then we can introduce an exponentially distributed variable y , and find the probability that x^2 is greater than 0.6 under the condition that the sum of x and y is less than 1 julia > y = exponential ( 0.5 ) julia > prob (x ^ 2 > 0.6 , x + y < 1 ) [ 0.053548951048950494 0.06132144691466614 ] Then, instead of computing conditional probabilities, we can sample from x under the same condition: julia > rand (x, x + y < 1 ) 0.04740462764340371
