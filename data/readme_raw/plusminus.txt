PlusMinus.jl Julia core maintainers suggested in this 2015 original issue that a plusminus function was not worthy of inclusion in Base Julia, much to the disappointment of statisticians everywhere. Fear not! This package implements the plus-minus function (and that's it!). plusminus (x :: Number ,y :: Number ) = (x - y,x + y) ±(x,y) = plusminus (x,y) # thats \pm followed by TAB 2 ± 1 # returns (1,3) The convention I use here is for the x-y to return first and x+y second. Because the output is a tuple, you can apply reverse to it to get the items in the other order. Alternatively, use direct assignment: minusitem,plusitem = 2 ± 1 . The package is registered, so can be added with ]add PlusMinus and available for use after using PlusMinus . Broadcasting is automatic because Julia rocks. (±).(1:3,1) == [(i-1,i+1) for i in 1:3] Flawlessly works with rationals as well. julia > 2 // 5 ± 1 // 2 ( - 1 // 10 , 9 // 10 )
