MATLABCluster.jl The MATLABCluster.jl package provides an interface for starting Julia worker processes using MATLAB™ Parallel Computing Toolbox cluster profiles, including profiles configured to connect to a MATLAB™ Distributed Computing Server . You cannot use MATLABCluster.jl without having purchased and installed a copy of MATLAB™ and the MATLAB™ Parallel Computing Toolbox from MathWorks . This package is available free of charge and in no way replaces or alters any functionality of MathWorks's MATLAB product. To connect to a MATLAB cluster: using MATLABCluster addprocs ( 1 , # The number of workers you want dir = " /path/to/julia/usr/bin " , # Path to Julia on your cluster cman = MATLABManager ( " profile " ), # The cluster profile, set up within MATLAB tunnel = true , # Only necessary if the workers are behind NAT sshflags = ` -c blowfish ` # Only for NAT; faster than AES (default) ) Caveats Currently output from the workers is not transmitted back to Julia This may not work if the MATLAB Job Scheduler is running on Windows (but let me know if you try)
