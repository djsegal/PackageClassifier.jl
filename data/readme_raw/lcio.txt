LCIO bindings for Julia Build Status: Documentation Status: Introduction This is a package for reading the LCIO file format, used for studies of the International Linear Collider, and other future collider concepts. See http://lcio.desy.de for details. Prerequisites The julia programming language: http://julialang.org/ A compiler that accepts the --std=c++-14 flag. Set the CXX and CC environment variables if this is different from your default compiler. LCIO will be built from source to reduce problems with version incompatibilities. Installation Instructions Make sure that the julia executable is in your $PATH environment variable, or your $JULIA_HOME variable is set to the directory that contains the julia executable. bash julia -e 'Pkg.add("LCIO")' If you want to get the latest version (which might have newer features (and bugs) than the latest release), you can run Pkg.checkout("LCIO") Pkg.build("LCIO") from the julia prompt; after the Pkg.add command. Philosophy We have attempted to achieve a faithful translation of the C++ API, with method names equal to those documented on the LCIO pages. Nevertheless, attempts have been made to improve the user experience. Examples: All collections are typed, no casting necessary Methods that return a float* or double* in the C++ API return a float64[] instead. Many of the methods on the C++ side returning pointers can return nullptr , so need to be wrapped in if clauses. The way to deal with this on the julia side is to use something like the following syntax: ok, value = getReferencePoint(particle) if ok println(value) end A notable exception is getPosition for hits, and getMomentum for particles, which we assume always return valid values Getting Started The basic construct for iterating over a file is this: using LCIO LCIO.open("file.slcio") do reader for event in reader println(getEventNumber(event)) end end There are more examples in the examples/ directory. Troubleshooting There are currently a couple of hiccups in the dependencies. Work to simplify the installation process is on-going, but in the meantime: Ubuntu 17.10: Install zlib, cmake, g++-7 through the package manager Download Julia from the julialang.org homepage Set the PATH variable such that you find the julia executable start julia Pkg.checkout("CxxWrap") Pkg.add("LCIO") Pkg.test("LCIO") If that doesn't work, please complain through the issues. I have not tested this on other systems recently.
