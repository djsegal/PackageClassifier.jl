Minimal Perfect Hashes A Julia module for generating minimal perfect hash functions for an array of strings: julia > using MinimalPerfectHashes julia > months = [ " jan " , " feb " , " mar " , " apr " , " may " , " jun " , " jul " , " aug " , " sep " , " oct " , " nov " , " dec " ] julia > mph = MinimalPerfectHash (months) julia > results = map ((x) -> hash (x, mph), months) 12 - element Int64 Array : 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 8 9 10 11 12 This is great for creating memory efficient lookup tables with an O(1) access time. Requirements Using MinimalPerfectHashes.jl requires that the following software be installed: Julia — The Julia language itself. Graphs.jl — Julia's graphs package, version 0.2.4 or greater. Installation MinimalPerfectHashes.jl should be available from METADATA.jl. To install MinimalPerfectHashes.jl, use the following: Pkg . add ( " MinimalPerfectHashes " ) If this does not work, git clone the repository in your ~/.julia/ directory. MinimalPerfectHashes.jl has one main module named MinimalPerfectHashes . You can load it as: using MinimalPerfectHashes Support You can check for @mweiden on the #julia IRC channel on Freenode.
