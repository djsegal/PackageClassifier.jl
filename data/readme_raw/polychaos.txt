PolyChaos -- Orthogonal Polynomials, Quadrature, and Polynomial Chaos A Julia package to construct orthogonal polynomials, their quadrature rules, and use it with polynomial chaos expansions. The package requires Julia 1.0 or newer. In Julia switch to the package manager julia > ] (v1 .0 ) pkg > add PolyChaos This will install PolyChaos and its dependencies. Once that is done, load the package: julia > using PolyChaos That's it. Let's take a look at a simple example. We would like to solve the integral Exploiting the underlying uniform measure, the integration can be done exactly with a 3-point quadrature rule. opq = Uniform01OrthoPoly(3) integrate(x -> 6x^5, opq) For more information please visit the documentation .
