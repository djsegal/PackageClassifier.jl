GLFW.jl Julia interface to GLFW 3 , a multi-platform library for creating windows with OpenGL or OpenGL ES contexts and receiving many kinds of input. GLFW has native support for Windows, OS X and many Unix-like systems using the X Window System, such as Linux and FreeBSD. Example using GLFW # Create a window and its OpenGL context window = GLFW . CreateWindow ( 640 , 480 , " GLFW.jl " ) # Make the window's context current GLFW . MakeContextCurrent (window) # Loop until the user closes the window while ! GLFW . WindowShouldClose (window) # Render here # Swap front and back buffers GLFW . SwapBuffers (window) # Poll for and process events GLFW . PollEvents () end GLFW . DestroyWindow (window) Interface Read the GLFW documentation for detailed instructions on how to use the library. The Julia interface is almost identical to the underlying C interface, with a few notable differences: Clipboard ( glfwGetClipboard , glfwSetClipboard ) and time ( glfwGetTime , glfwSetTime ) functions have been omitted because Julia's standard library already supports similar functionality. glfwInit and glfwTerminate are called automatically using the __init__ and atexit functions. While it is okay to still call them explicitly, it is redundant and not required. Footnotes Special thanks to @afterwise for writing an early implementation of GLFW 3 support.
