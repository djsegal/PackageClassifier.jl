GAPTypes.jl This module provides the abstract Julia type GapObj , which is used in GAP.jl to give the concrete internal GAP type MPtr an abstract type that it is derived from. If you want to use GAP.jl, please use this package and the GapObj type to define functions and structs that contain pure GAP objects.
