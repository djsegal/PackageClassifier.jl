UDUnits Installation Inside the Julia shell, you can download and install the package by issuing: using Pkg Pkg . add ( " UDUnits " ) Latest development version If you want to try the latest development version, you can do this with the following commands: using Pkg Pkg . add ( PackageSpec (url = " https://github.com/Alexander-Barth/UDUnits.jl " , rev = " master " )) Pkg . build ( " UDUnits " ) Loading the module The first step is to load the module UDUnits and to initialize the unit system sys which correspond to the SI unit system. using UDUnits sys = System () Units The unit objects can be created for m and cm using either their symbol or their full name by indexing the sys object as if sys is a dictionary. m = sys[ " meter " ] cm = sys[ " cm " ] Similarily to a dictionary, the function haskey is defined to determine if a unit is valid: haskey (sys, " Î¼m " ) # returns true since UDUnits knows about micrometers Derived units Units can be derived using the usual mathemical operators. Of course, m_per_s could have been also create simply by using sys["m/s"] . m = sys[ " m " ] km = sys[ " km " ] s = sys[ " s " ] h = sys[ " h " ] m_per_s = m / s km_per_h = km / h Converting data The function areconvertible returns true if two units are convertible: @show areconvertible (m_per_s,km_per_h) To convert units, create a converter object and then apply the object to some data. conv = Converter (m_per_s,km_per_h) speed_in_m_per_s = 100. speed_in_km_per_h = conv (speed_in_m_per_s) The dot syntax can be used for an array as input: speed_in_m_per_s = [ 100. , 110. , 120. ] speed_in_km_per_h = conv .(speed_in_m_per_s) Windows I did not succeed to install UDUnits.jl on Windows using the package manager Conda. One way to make it work on Windows is to bypass Conda: extract udunits2.dll and all xml files from https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/udunits2/2.2.23/download/win-64/udunits2-2.2.23-vc9_1.tar.bz2 expat.dll from https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/expat/2.1.0/download/win-64/expat-2.1.0-vc9_1.tar.bz2 place all these files in the deps folder of UDUnits (i.e. the output of joinpath(Pkg.dir("UDUnits"),"deps") ) run Pkg . build ( " UDUnits " ) before any call to using UDUnits or import UDUnits , set the following variable: ENV[ " UDUNITS2_XML_PATH " ] = joinpath (Pkg . dir ( " UDUnits " ), " deps " , " udunits2.xml " ) Resources Documentation of the C-library
