 Cite as ↗ Project goals Design a comprehensive framework for geostatistics (or spatial statistics) in a modern programming language. Address the lack of a platform for scientific comparison of different geostatistical algorithms in the literature. Exploit modern hardware aggressively, including GPUs and computer clusters. Educate people outside of the field about the existence of geostatistics. Installation Get the latest stable release with Julia's package manager: ] add GeoStats Documentation STABLE — most recently tagged version of the documentation. LATEST — in-development version of the documentation. Tutorials A set of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the current functionality of the package is available in GeoStatsTutorials . Below is a quick preview of the high-level API. For the full example, please check this notebook . using GeoStats using Plots # data.csv: # x, y, station, precipitation # 25.0, 25.0, palo alto, 1.0 # 50.0, 75.0, redwood city, 0.0 # 75.0, 50.0, mountain view, 1.0 # read spreadsheet file containing spatial data sdata = readgeotable ( " data.csv " , coordnames = [ :x , :y ]) # define spatial domain (e.g. regular grid, point collection) sdomain = RegularGrid {Float64} ( 100 , 100 ) # define estimation problem for any data column(s) (e.g. :precipitation) problem = EstimationProblem (sdata, sdomain, :precipitation ) # choose a solver from the list of solvers solver = Kriging ( :precipitation => (variogram = GaussianVariogram (range = 35. ),) ) # solve the problem solution = solve (problem, solver) # plot the solution contourf (solution, clabels = true ) Project organization The project is split into various packages: Package Description GeoStats.jl Main package reexporting full stack of packages for geostatistics. Variography.jl Variogram estimation and modeling, and related tools. KrigingEstimators.jl High-performance implementations of Kriging estimators. PointPatterns.jl Spatial point pattern analysis and synthesis. GeoStatsImages.jl Training images for multiple-point geostatistical simulation. GslibIO.jl Utilities to read/write extended GSLIB files. GeoStatsBase.jl Base package containing problem and solution specifications (for developers). The main package (i.e. GeoStats.jl) is self-contained, and provides the full stack of packages for high-performance geostatistics over arbitrary domains. Other packages like GeoStatsImages.jl can be installed from the list above for additional functionality. Problems and solvers Solvers for geostatistical problems can be installed separately depending on the application. They are automatically integrated with GeoStats.jl thanks to Julia's multiple dispatch features.
