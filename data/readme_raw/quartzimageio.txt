QuartzImageIO This package provides support for loading and saving images using native libraries on macOS. This package was split off from Images.jl to make image I/O more modular. Installation Add the package with Pkg . add ( " QuartzImageIO " ) Usage QuartzImageIO will be used as needed if you've said using FileIO in your session or module. You should not generally say using QuartzImageIO . See FileIO for further details. It's worth pointing out that packages such as Images load FileIO. Alternatives If QuartzImageIO does not provide the functionality you need, an alternative is ImageMagick . You can have both packages installed, and FileIO will manage their interaction.
