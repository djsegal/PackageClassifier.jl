Deprecated This repo has some nasty bug, see broken tests. After bug hunt a decission to refactor led to the rewriting of the package, which gave the opportunity to change the license. Development continues in BoundingSphere.jl . Use that package instead. Miniball.jl is a part of JuliaFEM This is a Julia package for finding the smallest enclosing sphere for a set of points in an arbitrary number of dimensions. The implementation is based on Bernd GÃ¤rtner's C++ Miniball but is implemented entirely in Julia. The original C++ implementation is licensed under GNU General Public License (GPLv3) , which is why this implementation also has the same license. Some examples of the usage julia > using Miniball julia > ball = miniball ([ 1.0 0.0 ; 0.0 1.0 ]) julia > ball . center [ 0.5 , 0.5 ] julia > ball . squared_radius 0.5 julia > ball = miniball ([ - 1.0 0.0 ; 1.0 0.0 ; 0.0 1.0 ; 0.0 - 1.0 ]) julia > ball . center ([ 0.0 , 0.0 ], 1.0 ) julia > ball . squared_radius 1.0 julia > ball = miniball ( rand ( 1000000 , 3 )) julia > ball . center [ 0.502234 , 0.495934 , 0.504458 ] julia > ball . squared_center 0.7283212748080066 Original Miniball documentation http://www-oldurls.inf.ethz.ch/personal/gaertner/miniball.html
