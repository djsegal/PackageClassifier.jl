JuliaDBMeta JuliaDBMeta is a set of macros to simplify data manipulation with JuliaDB , heavily inspired on DataFramesMeta . It exploits the technical advantages of JuliaDB: Fully typed tables with type stable column extraction Fast row iteration Parallel data storage and parallel computations Some ideas also come from Query.jl , in particular the curly bracket syntax is from there. The macro packages Lazy and MacroTools were also very useful in designing this package: the @apply macro is inspired by the concatenation macros in Lazy.
