MarriageMarkets The MarriageMarkets package currently provides two marriage market models as Julia types: StaticMatch : computes the equilibrium of the static frictionless marriage market model from "Who Marries Whom and Why" (Choo & Siow, 2006). SearchMatch : computes the equilibrium of variants on the search and matching model from "Assortative Matching and Search" (Shimer & Smith, 2000) and the empirical extension in "Marriage Gains" (Goussé, 2014). SearchMatch also allows for inflows of new singles as well as deaths. Installation In a Julia REPL, enter pkg mode (by pressing ] ) and run: (v1 .0 ) pkg > add MarriageMarkets Julia version 1.0 or higher is required (installation instructions here ). Usage As SearchMatch supports a number of model variants, there are specific constructors for the two main types: SearchClosed : closed-system where agents cycle between singlehood and marriage SearchInflow : steady-state population is determined by exogenous inflows and type-specific death rates All models support both unidimensional and multidimensional agent types. To specify a multidimensional type space, use a Vector of Vector s, e.g., [[1,1.5,1.7], [0,1]] Examples Here are some simple examples of solving models with unidimensional types. I use Gadfly to plot the resulting equilibrium objects. Static model using MarriageMarkets using Gadfly n = 50 # number of types Θ = collect ( range ( 0.1 , stop = 1.0 , length = n)) # type space vector m = ones (n) ./ n # uniform population measures f (x,y) = x * y # marital surplus function (per capita) static_mgmkt = StaticMatch (Θ, Θ, m, m, f) plot (z = static_mgmkt . matches, Geom . contour, Guide . title ( " Distribution of matches " )) The saddle shape indicates positive assortative matching, as expected, due to the supermodular production function f(x,y) = x*y . Search model The example below solves a search model with inflows and death. Then I plot the probabilities of match formation conditional on meeting. using MarriageMarkets using Gadfly λ, δ = 500.0 , 0.05 # arrival rates of meetings and divorce shocks r = 0.05 # discount rate σ = 1 # variance of Normally distributed match-specific productivity shocks n = 50 # number of types Θ = collect ( range ( 0.1 , stop = 1.0 , length = n)) # type space vector f (x,y) = x * y # marital production function γ = ones (n) ./ n # uniform inflows ψ = ones (n) # uniform death rates search_mgmkt = SearchInflow (λ, δ, r, σ, Θ, Θ, γ, γ, ψ, ψ, f) plot (z = search_mgmkt . α, Geom . contour, Guide . title ( " Match probability conditional on meeting " )) Testing In a Julia REPL session, enter pkg mode and run test MarriageMarkets .
