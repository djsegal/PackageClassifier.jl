ProximalOperators.jl Proximal operators for nonsmooth optimization in Julia. This package can be used to easily implement proximal algorithms for convex and nonconvex optimization problems such as ADMM, the alternating direction method of multipliers. See the documentation on how to use the package. Installation To install the package, hit ] from the Julia command line to enter the package manager, then pkg > add ProximalOperators Usage With using ProximalOperators the package exports the prox and prox! methods to evaluate the proximal mapping of several functions. A list of available function constructors is in the documentation . For example, you can create the L1-norm as follows. julia > f = NormL1 ( 3.5 ) description : weighted L1 norm type : Array{Complex} → Real expression : x ↦ λ || x || _1 parameters : λ = 3.5 Functions created this way are, of course, callable. julia > x = randn ( 10 ) # some random point julia > f (x) 32.40700818735099 prox evaluates the proximal operator associated with a function, given a point and (optionally) a positive stepsize parameter, returning the proximal point y and the value of the function at y : julia > y, fy = prox (f, x, 0.5 ) # last argument is 1.0 if absent prox! evaluates the proximal operator in place , and only returns the function value at the proximal point: julia > fy = prox! (y, f, x, 0.5 ) # in-place equivalent to y, fy = prox(f, x, 0.5) Related packages FirstOrderSolvers.jl ProximalAlgorithms.jl StructuredOptimization.jl References N. Parikh and S.
