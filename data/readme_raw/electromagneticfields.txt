ElectromagneticFields.jl Common Interface for Electromagnetic Fields ElectromagneticFields.jl provides a common interface for evaluating analytical and numerical magnetic equilibria, general electromagnetic fields and in the future also simple Maxwell solvers. For analytical equilibria, it generates Julia code providing high-level evaluation routines. Numerical equilibria are interpolated using ApproXD and can be evaluated with the very same interface as the analytical equilibria. Features Analytical equilibria: simple axisymmetric tokamak equilibrium in cartesian, cylindrical and toroidal coordinates flexible Solov'ev equilibria with and without X-point simple quadratic Solov'ev equilibrium as well as symmetric quadratic field ABC field 3D perturbations (e.g., magnetic islands) Numerical equilibria (planned): projected analytic equilibria EFIT VMEC Numerical solvers (planned): B-Spline, FEM and pseudo-spectral Poisson, Ampère and Faraday solvers References Antoine J.
