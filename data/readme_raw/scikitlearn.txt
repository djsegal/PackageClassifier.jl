ScikitLearn.jl ScikitLearn.jl implements the popular scikit-learn interface and algorithms in Julia. It supports both models from the Julia ecosystem and those of the scikit-learn library (via PyCall.jl). Would you rather use a machine-learning framework specially-designed for Julia? Check out MLJ.jl , from the Alan Turing institute. Disclaimer : ScikitLearn.jl borrows code and documentation from scikit-learn , but it is not an official part of that project . It is licensed under BSD-3 . Main features: Around 150 Julia and Python models accessed through a uniform interface Pipelines and FeatureUnions Cross-validation Hyperparameter tuning DataFrames support Check out the Quick-Start Guide for a tour. Installation To install ScikitLearn.jl, type ]add ScikitLearn at the REPL. To import Python models (optional), ScikitLearn.jl requires the scikit-learn Python library , which will be installed automatically when needed. Most of the examples use PyPlot.jl Documentation See the manual and example gallery . Goal ScikitLearn.jl aims for feature parity with scikit-learn. If you encounter any problem that is solved by that library but not this one, file an issue .
