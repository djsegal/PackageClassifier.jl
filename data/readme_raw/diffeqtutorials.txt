DiffEqTutorials.jl DiffEqTutorials.jl holds PDFs, webpages, and interactive Jupyter notebooks showing how to utilize the software in the JuliaDiffEq ecosystem. This set of tutorials was made to complement the documentation and the devdocs by providing practical examples of the concepts. For more details, please consult the docs. Interactive Notebooks To run the tutorials interactively via Jupyter notebooks, install the package and open the tutorials like: using Pkg pkg " add https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqTutorials.jl " using DiffEqTutorials DiffEqTutorials . open_notebooks () Video Tutorial Table of Contents Introduction Introduction to DifferentialEquations.jl through ODEs Detecting Stiffness and Choosing an ODE Algorithm Optimizing your DiffEq Code Callbacks and Event Handling Formatting Plots Exercise Sheets DifferentialEquations.jl Workshop Exercises DifferentialEquations.jl Workshop Exercise Solutions Modeling Examples Classical Physics Models Conditional Dosing Example DiffEqBiological Tutorial I: Introduction DiffEqBiological Tutorial II: Network Properties API DiffEqBiological Tutorial III: Steady-States and Bifurcations Kepler Problem Orbit Bayesian Inference of Pendulum Parameters Advanced ODE Features ModelingToolkit.jl, An IR and Compiler for Scientific Models Feagin's Order 10, 12, and 14 Methods Finding Maxima and Minima of DiffEq Solutions Monte Carlo Parameter Estimation from Data Type Handling Solving Equations with Julia-Defined Types Numbers with Uncertainties Unit Check Arithmetic via Unitful.jl Advanced A 2D Cardiac Electrophysiology Model (CUDA-accelerated PDE solver) Solving Stiff Equations Contributing First of all, make sure that your current directory is DiffEqTutorials . All of the files are generated from the Weave.jl files in the tutorials folder. To run the generation process, do for example: using Pkg, DiffEqTutorials cd ( joinpath ( dirname ( pathof (DiffEqTutorials)), " .. " )) Pkg . pkg " activate . " Pkg . pkg " instantiate " DiffEqTutorials . weave_file ( " introduction " , " ode_introduction.jmd " ) To generate all of the notebooks, do: DiffEqTutorials . weave_all () If you add new tutorials which require new packages, simply updating your local environment will change the project and manifest files. When this occurs, the updated environment files should be included in the PR.
