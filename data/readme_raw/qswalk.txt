QSWalk Package description QSWalk provides a package for Julia programming language which enables high-performance analysis of quantum stochastic walks. There are two main advantages of the presented packages over the existing software. First, it can be use to describe quantum stochastic walks in the local, as well as global regime. Second, it enables the user to seamlessly utilize parallel computing capabilities. Installation The package can be installed simply with Pkg REPL: (v1.0) pkg> add QSWalk Examples Examples can be found in examples subdirectory. They require QSWalk , LightGraphs , and PyPlot .
