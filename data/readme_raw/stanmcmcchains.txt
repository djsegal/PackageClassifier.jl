StanMCMCChains Introduction This package converts the output produced by CmdStan.jl to a TuringLang/Chains object suitable for further processing by the MCMCChains package. Usage In the definition of the Stanmodel, request the output_format=:mcmcchains: stanmodel = Stanmodel(num_samples=1200, thin=2, name="bernoulli", model=bernoullimodel, output_format=:mcmcchains); The subsequent call to stan() will now return a MCMCChains.Chains object in chains as in the included Bernoulli example: ... (snipped) rc, chains, cnames = stan(stanmodel, observeddata, ProjDir, diagnostics=false, CmdStanDir=CMDSTAN_HOME); ... (snipped) It is also possible to do this conversion after the call to stan(): stanmodel = Stanmodel(num_samples=1200, thin=2, name="bernoulli", model=bernoullimodel); rc, sims, cnames = stan(stanmodel, observeddata, ProjDir, diagnostics=false, CmdStanDir=CMDSTAN_HOME); chains = convert_a3d(sims, cnames, Val(:mcmcchains)) The bernoulli example also demonstrated how a Chains object can be saved and restored. Further examples Several more examples will be contained in StanMCMCChainsExamples.jl .
