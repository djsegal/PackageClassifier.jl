Extensions to HDF5.jl Installation using Pkg pkg " add HDF5Utils " Usage using HDF5, HDF5Utils Save data with 8-byte alignment for reading back later using mmap. h5save ( " test.h5 " , Dict ( " x " => UInt8[ 0 ], " y " => Float64[ 0 ])) h5open (tryreadmmap, " test.h5 " ) Convert String to MaxLenString to save space. MLString {5} .([ " a " , " b " ]) Save MaxLenString as HDF5's fixed size string. h5save ( " test.h5 " , Dict ( " x " => MLString{ 5 }[ " α " " β " ; " γ " " δ " ])) Save NamedTuple as HDF5's compound. h5save ( " test.h5 " , Dict ( " x " => [(a = 1 , b = 1 f0)])) Concatenate datasets in multiple HDF5 files along a given dimension ( -2 represents end - 1 ). h5concat ( " concat.h5 " , repeat ([ " test.h5 " ], 100 ), dim = - 2 )
