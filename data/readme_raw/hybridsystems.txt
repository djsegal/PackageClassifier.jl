HybridSystems Documentation Build Status References to cite This packages defines an interface for defining and working with Hybrid Systems . It also includes an implementation of this interface. The goal of this package is twofold help making algorithms on Hybrid Systems independent of the particular data structure used to represent them. help users to try many different tools for Hybrid Systems without needed to deal with different interfaces. The following package implements hybrid systems representations using this interface: SX : SpaceEx modeling language parser The following package implements algorithms using this interface: SwitchOnSafety : Computing invariant sets of hybrid systems. Reachability : Computing reachable states of hybrid dynamical systems. Documentation STABLE — most recently tagged version of the documentation. LATEST — in-development version of the documentation.
