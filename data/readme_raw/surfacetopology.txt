SurfaceTopology.jl As we know, triangular meshes can be stored in a computer in multiple different ways, each having strength and weaknesses in a particular case at hand. But it is not always clear which data structure would be most suitable for a specific task. Thus it is wise to write a data structure generic code which is the precise purpose of this package for closed oriented closed surfaces.
