Simple DirectMedia Layer Bindings for the Simple DirectMedia Layer library. The bindings were generated using Clang.jl . It's recommended to declare a shorthand for the package after using it: using SimpleDirectMediaLayer const SDL = SimpleDirectMediaLayer The SDL_ prefix was trimmed from names so functions and types can be accessed as SDL.foo instead of SDL_foo . Documentation can be found on the SDL wiki . A few examples are available here . License This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
