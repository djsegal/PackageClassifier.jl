AlgebraResultTypes A Julia package for calculating result types of arithmetic operations. Motivation A lot of Julia code contains some simple functions to calculate the result types of arithmetic operations. This package aims to be a well-tested centralized implementation of these. The package is really lightweight and has no dependencies. Usage julia > using AlgebraResultTypes : result_field, result_ring # no exported symbols julia > result_field (Float64, Int) Float64 julia > result_field (Int, Int) Float64 julia > result_ring (Int, Int) Int julia > result_field (Real) Number # non-concrete fallback How can you help Add tests for other types, especially if defined in another package. If the tests pass, please make a PR. If they don't, please open an issue, or (ideally) make a PR that includes fixes.
