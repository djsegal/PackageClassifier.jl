SnoopCompile SnoopCompile observes the Julia compiler, causing it to record the functions and argument types it's compiling. From these lists of methods, you can generate lists of precompile directives that may reduce the latency between loading packages and using them to do "real work." See the documentation: Packages that use SnoopCompile Quite a few packages have used SnoopCompile to reduce startup latency, and some have preserved their scripts which may serve as an example to other users: MatLang ( SnoopFile Folder and source file ).
