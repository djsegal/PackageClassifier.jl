KernSmooth About KernSmooth.jl is the a partial port of the R package KernSmooth , (v2.23-10.) The R package carries an unlimited license. Currently the locpoly and dpill functions are ported. locpoly uses local polynomials to estimate pdf of a single variable or a regression function for two variables, or their derivatives. dpill provides a method to select a bandwidth for local linear regression. Other functionality provided by the R package but not ported to KernSmooth.jl pertains to univariate and bivariate kernel density estimation. Univariate and bivariate kernel density estimation is provided by the kde function in StatsBase.jl . Usage locpoly - Estimate regression or density functions or their derivatives using local polynomials The method signatures: locpoly (x :: Vector{Float64} , y :: Vector{Float64} , bandwidth :: Union(Float64, Vector{Float64}) ; drv :: Int = 0 , degree :: Int = drv + 1 , kernel :: Symbol = :normal , gridsize :: Int = 401 , bwdisc :: Int = 25 , range_x :: Vector{Float64} = Float64[], binned :: Bool = false , truncate :: Bool = true ) locpoly (x :: Vector{Float64} , bandwidth :: Union(Float64, Vector{Float64}) ; args ... ) x - vector of x data y - vector of y data. For density estimation (of x ), y should be omitted or be an empty Vector{T} bandwidth - should be a scalar or vector of length gridsize Other arguments are optional. For their descriptions, see the R documentation A (Vector{Float64}, Vector{Float64}) is returned. The first vector is the sorted set of points at which an estimate was computed. The estimates are in the second vector. dpill - Direct plug-in method to select a bandwidth for local linear Gaussian kernel regression The method signature function dpill (x :: Vector{Float64} , y :: Vector{Float64} ; blockmax :: Int = 5 , divisor :: Int = 20 , trim :: Float64 = 0.01 , proptrun :: Float64 = 0.05 , gridsize :: Int = 401 , range_x :: Vector{Float64} = Float64[], truncate = true ) x - vector of x data y - vector of y data. Other arguments are optional. For their descriptions, see the R documentation Regression example Estimate regression using different bandwidths, including the bandwidth selected by dpill . xgrid2, yhat0_5 = locpoly (x, y, 0.5 ) yhat1_0 = locpoly (x, y, 1.0 )[ 2 ] yhat2_0 = locpoly (x, y, 2.0 )[ 2 ] h = dpill (x, y) yhath = locpoly (x, y, h)[ 2 ] A plot of the estimates and true regression: The full code for the example is here .
