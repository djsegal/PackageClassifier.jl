SMM.jl: Simulated Method of Moments for Julia Documentation Build Status Notice : this package was previously called MomentOpt.jl . This package provides a Julia infrastructure for Simulated Method of Moments estimation, or other problems where we want to optimize a non-differentiable objective function. The setup is suitable for all kinds of likelihood-free estimators - in general, those require evaluating the objective at many regions. The user can supply their own algorithms for generating successive new parameter guesses. We provide a set of MCMC template algorithms. The code can be run in serial or on a cluster. Installation In your julia REPL, type ] add SMM Documentation Example Notebook Please check out a fully worked example in src/example.ipynb . Contributing We encourage user contributions. Please submit a pull request for any improvements you would like to suggest, or a new algorithm you implemented. New algorithms: You can model your algo on the basis of src/AlgoBGP.jl - you need to implement the function computeNextIteration!( algo ) for your algo History This package grew out of the R package mopt .
