ParticleScattering A Julia package for solving large-scale electromagnetic scattering problems in two dimensions; specifically, those containing a large number of penetrable smooth particles. Provides the ability to optimize over the particle parameters for various design problems. Installation ParticleScattering for julia 0.7 can be installed using Pkg.add : Pkg . add ( " ParticleScattering " ) using ParticleScattering For julia 0.6, an older version of ParticleScattering can be installed manually by cloning release v0.0.4 from GitHub . Community The easiest way to contribute is by opening issues! Of course, we'd be more than happy if you implement any fixes and send a PR. If you have any relevant scattering problems that would make good examples for the docs, feel free to open an issue for that as well.
