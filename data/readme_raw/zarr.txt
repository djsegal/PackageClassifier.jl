Zarr.jl Zarr is a Julia package providing an implementation of chunked, compressed, N-dimensional arrays. Zarr is originally a Python package. In Zarr we aim to implement the zarr spec . Documentation Build Status Package status The package currently implements basic functionality for reading and writing zarr arrays. However, the package is under active development, since many compressors and backends supported by the python implementation are still missing. Quick start using Zarr z1 = zcreate (Int, 10000 , 10000 ,path = " data/example.zarr " ,chunks = ( 1000 , 1000 )) z1[:] = 42 z1[:, 1 ] = 1 : 10000 z1[ 1 ,:] = 1 : 10000 z2 = zopen ( " data/example.zarr " ) z2[ 1 : 10 , 1 : 10 ] Links https://discourse.julialang.org/t/a-julia-compatible-alternative-to-zarr/11842 https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr/issues/284 https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/v2.html
