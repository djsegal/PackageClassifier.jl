LuxurySparse.jl High performance extension for sparse matrices. Contents General Permutation Matrix PermMatrix , Identity Matrix IMatrix , Coordinate Format Matrix SparseMatrixCOO , Static Matrices SSparseMatrixCSC , SPermMatrix et. al. with high performance type convertion , kron and multiplication operations. Installation Install with the package manager, pkg> add LuxurySparse . How to use Here is a simple example using SparseArrays using LuxurySparse using BenchmarkTools pm = pmrand ( 7 ) # a random permutation matrix id = IMatrix ( 3 ) # an identity matrix @benchmark kron (pm, id) # kronecker product Spm = pm |> SparseMatrixCSC # convertion to SparseMatrixCSC Sid = id |> SparseMatrixCSC @benchmark kron (Spm, Sid) # compare the performance. spm = pm |> staticize # convertion to static matrices, notice `id` is already static. @benchmark kron (spm, spm) # compare the performance. @benchmark kron (pm, pm) # compare the performance. For more information, please refer the latest document . Planned features Change PermMatrix to column major Better support to static matrices.
