ImageComponentAnalysis A Julia package containing a number of algorithms for analyzing connected components in binary images. In general, the input is an array of labelled components, and the output is a DataFrame where each row represents a connected components, and each column represents an attribute of that connected component. When combined with Query it affords a very flexible and easy way of filtering connected components based on their attributes. The general usage pattern of this package is: measurements = analyze_components (components, algorithm :: AbstractComponentAnalysisAlgorithm ) For more detailed usage and a full list of algorithms, please check the documentation .
