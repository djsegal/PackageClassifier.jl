Kernel Methods KernelMethods.jl is a library that implements and explores Kernel-Based Methods for supervised learning and semi-supervised learning . Install To start using KernelMethods.jl just type into an active Julia session using Pkg pkg " add https://github.com/sadit/KernelMethods.jl " using KernelMethods Usage KernelMethods.jl consists of the following parts Scores . It contains several common performance measures, i.e., accuracy, recall, precision, f1, precision_recall. CrossValidation . Some methods to perform cross validation, all of them work through callback functions: montecarlo kfolds Supervised . It contains methods related to supervised learning NearNeighborClassifier . It defines a KNN classifier optimize! predict predict_proba Note: user defined distance functions are accepted; several common distances can be found in SimilaritySearch.jl Dependencies KernelMethods.jl depends on SimilaritySearch.jl Final notes To reach maximum performance, please ensure that Julia has access to the specific instruction set of your CPUs http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/devdocs/sysimg/
