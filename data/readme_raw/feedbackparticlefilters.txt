FeedbackParticleFilters.jl This package's aim is to provide a versatile and efficient feedback particle filter implementation in Julia, with abstractions to flexibly construct, run, and analyze feedback particle filters for a variety of uni- and multivariate filtering problems with both diffusion and point process observations. In particular, the following features are planned to be implemented in FeedbackParticleFilters: Types for hidden state and observation models: diffusions, Poisson processes, etc. A variety of gain estimation methods Automatic filter deployment and simulation of the state and filtering equations Storing of intermediate (trajectory) data from simulation An interface to the powerful solvers from the DifferentialEquations package Installation Use the built-in package manager: using Pkg Pkg . add ( " FeedbackParticleFilters " ) Usage To load the package, use the command: using FeedbackParticleFilters Set up a basic one-dimensional linear-Gaussian continuous-time filtering problem: using Distributions state_model = ScalarDiffusionStateModel (x -> - x, x -> sqrt ( 2. ), Normal ()) obs_model = ScalarDiffusionObservationModel (x -> x) filt_prob = FilteringProblem (state_model, obs_model) Once the filtering problem is defined, an appropriate filtering algorithm can be defined like this: method = ConstantGainApproximation () filter = FPF (filt_prob, method, 100 ) The package comes with methods to automatically simulate a given system: simulation = ContinuousTimeSimulation (filt_prob, filter, 10000 , 0.01 ) run!
