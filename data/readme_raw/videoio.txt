As such, tests for frame comparison are currently skipped on ARM. Issues/PRs welcome for helping to get this fixed.

Contributions are very welcome, as are feature requests and suggestions. Please open an issue if you encounter any problems. * Note that coveralls.io code coverage includes all of the Clang.jl -generated wrappers for FFMPEG, the majority of which are currently unused
