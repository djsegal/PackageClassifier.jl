StrEntities Info Windows Linux & MacOS Package Evaluator CodeCov Coveralls StrEntities extends the string literals provided by the StrLiterals package. It adds support for HTML, LaTeX, Unicode and Emoji entities, provided by the packages: HTML_Entities LaTeX_Entities Emoji_Entities Unicode_Entities This adds four ways of representing characters in the literal string, \:emojiname: , \<latexname> , \&htmlname; and \N{UnicodeName} . This makes life a lot easier when you want to keep the text of a program in ASCII, and also to be able to write programs using those characters that might not even display correctly in their editor. \< followed by a LaTeX entity name followed by > outputs that character or sequence if the name is valid. \: followed by an Emoji name followed by : outputs that character or sequence (if a valid name) \& followed by an HTML entity name followed by ; outputs that character or sequence (if a valid name) \N{ followed by a Unicode entity name (case-insensitive!) followed by a } outputs that Unicode character (if a valid name)
