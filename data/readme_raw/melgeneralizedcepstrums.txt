MelGeneralizedCepstrums MelGeneralizedCepstrums.jl provides a mel generalized cepstrum anlysis for spectral envelope estimation that includes: linear predicition analysis (LPC) generalized cepstrum analysis mel-cepstrum analysis mel-generalized cepstrum analysis The package also provides conversions, e.g, mel-generalized cepstrum to mel-cepstrum, mel-cepstrum to (linear frequency) cepstrum, mel-cesptrum to filter coefficients, and vise versa. Note that this package is built on top of SPTK.jl . The package is designed to provide a Julia-like interface with a focus on the mel-generalized cepstrum analysis. A part of the core is re-writen in Julia from Speech Signal Processing Toolkit (SPTK) .
