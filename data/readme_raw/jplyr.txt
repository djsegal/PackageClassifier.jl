StructuredQueries a generic query representation framework for Julia. Installation StructuredQueries.jl is registered in METADATA.jl . Install it with julia> Pkg.add("StructuredQueries") This package supports Julia 0.5. Objectives The present package aims to support a querying framework that is Generic -- the framework should be able to support multiple backends. Modular -- the framework should encourage modularity of collection machinery. Extensible -- the framework should be easily extensible to represent (relatively) arbitrary manipulations. Ergonomic -- the framework should allow users to express their intentions easily. Documentation ... Is currently offline, since I just (as of 11/16/16) redesigned much of this package. Documentation will catch up in December, once this academic quarter is over.
