GZip.jl: A Julia interface for gzip functions in zlib This module provides a wrapper for the gzip related functions of zlib , a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered, lossless data-compression library. These functions allow the reading and writing of gzip files. Install with Pkg.add("GZip") at the Julia prompt. Usage Typical usage would be something like import GZip fh = GZip . open ( " infile.gz " ) s = readline (fh) ... close (fh) ... s = " gzip is part of zlib, a free, general-purpose, " * " legally unencumbered, lossless data-compression library " fh = GZip . open ( " outfile.gz " , " w " ) write (fh, s) ... close (fh) See the documentation for additional information.
