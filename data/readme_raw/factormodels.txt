FactorModels Factor Models for Julia [Factor models] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_factor ) or diffusion index models are statistical models which allow the estimation of a dependent variable using potentially very many regressors. Factor models are related to [factor analysis] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis ). This package has a strong focus on the econometric literature related to factor models. This is because I wrote the package for my master thesis. Resultingly the predict method refers to time-series data and estimates a factor augmented regression. If you feel something relevant is missing please feel free to open an issue or a pull request. As soon as I my thesis is handed in I will provide a proper README (and add some tests). Installation This package is not released as a Julia package (yet) as it is in an unfinished state. You have been warned. You can install it using julia > Pkg . clone ( " FactorModels " ) Usage x = randn ( 50 , 200 ) # no problem to use more columns than rows, that is one of the nice features of factor models fm = FactorModel (x) fm = FactorModel (x, 5 ) # use only 5 factors fm = FactorModel (x, " ICp2 " ) # use one of the criteria defined by Bai, Ng (2002) dfm = DynamicFactorModel ((x, " ICp2 " ), 5 ) # DynamicFactorModels take a tuple of arguments which is passend on to FactorModel and the number of factor lags used for prediction predictions can be done using predict (fm :: FactorModel , y :: Array{Float64, 1} , h :: Int64 = 1 , number_of_lags :: Int64 = 5 , number_of_factors :: Int64 = 0 ) or predict (dfm :: DynamicFactorModel , y :: Array{Float64, 1} , h :: Int64 = 1 , number_of_lags :: Int64 = 5 , number_of_factors :: Int64 = 0 ) This estimates a linear model using number_of_lags lags of y, number_of_factors factors (and the number of lags thereof specified above in the case of dynamic factor models). Features Simulate and Estimate Dynamic factor models Estimate the number of Factors Use the estimation for prediction Preselect predictors using soft and hard thresholding (see Bai, Jushan, and Serena Ng.
