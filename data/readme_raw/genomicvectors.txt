GenomicVectors GenomicVectors is an alternate implementation of the GPos and GenomicRanges types from Bioconductor's GenomicRanges package by P. Aboyoun, H. Pages and M. Lawrence. These GenomicPositions and GenomicRanges types are Vectors that serve as markers of locations on a given genome. They can be used independently or as indices and/or annotation on other objects.
