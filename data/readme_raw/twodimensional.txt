TwoDimensional Documentation License Build Status Code Coverage TwoDimensional is a Julia package which provides useful types and methods to define and manipulate 2-dimensional points, bounding boxes and affine coordinate transforms. Other related packages: CoordinateTransformations Usage using TwoDimensional gives you types AffineTransform{T} , Point{T} and BoundingBox{T} parameterized by the type T of their components ( T must be floating point for AffineTransform{T} ). To avoid conflicts with other packages, you may use/import TwoDimensional.Suffixed which gives you types AffineTransform2D{T} , Point2D{T} and BoundingBox2D{T} instead, that is with suffix 2D . You can also fine tune what you want. For instance: using TwoDimensional : AffineTransform, Point2D Latest documentation is here . Installation TwoDimensional is not yet an official Julia package so you have to clone the repository. In Julia, hit the ] key to switch to the package manager REPL (you should get a ... pkg> prompt) and type: pkg > add https : // github . com / emmt / TwoDimensional . jl if you use HTTPS, or: pkg > add git @github . com : emmt / TwoDimensional . jl if you use SSH.
