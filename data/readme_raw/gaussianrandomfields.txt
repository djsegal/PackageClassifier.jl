GaussianRandomFields A Julia package to compute and sample from Gaussian random fields. Key Features Support for stationary (isotropic and anisotropic) and separable non-stationary covariance functions. We provide most standard covariance functions such as Gaussian, Exponential and Matérn covariances. Adding a user-defined covariance function is very easy. Implementation of most common methods to generate Gaussian random fields: Cholesky factorization, Karhunen-Loève expansion and circulant embedding. Easy generation of Gaussian random fields defined on a Finite Element mesh. Versatile plotting features for easy visualisation of Gaussian random fields.
