Trajectories A trajectory in the sense of this package is a vector of time points t and a corresponding vector of spatial points x , which are though as locations x[i] of an object at times t[i] . A key decision which has to be made for a time series object, is whether iteration is used to iterate values, pairs or is leveraged for destruction. See issue #1. At the moment, all iteration and destructuring is explicit. To iterate values xᵢ , pairs (tᵢ, xᵢ) or components (t, x) , use values , pairs or Pair tᵢ in keys (X) xᵢ in values (X) (tᵢ, xᵢ) in pairs (X) t, x = Pair (X) A second key decision is what constitutes indexing. Also here this package is agnostic : Only key look-up with get is implemented so far. Trajectories support Tables.jl with columns being a named tuple (t = X.t, x = X.x) .
