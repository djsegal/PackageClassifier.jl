CausalityTools Build status Documentation CausalityTools.jl provides tools for nonparametric detection of causal relationships between dynamical variables based on time series of observations. Check out the documentation for more information! Key features The package is equally well-suited both for the study of causal directionality for experimental data, and for studying theoretical systems. Key features include: Integration with UncertainData.jl , which makes handling uncertainties in your causality analyses a breeze. Integration with DynamicalSystems.jl , which allows the causality statitics to be applied to dynamical systems . Library of coupled dynamical systems for testing algorithm performance. Installation CausalityTools.jl is a registered julia package, you can therefore add the latest tagged release by running the following lines in the Julia console. import Pkg; Pkg . add ( " CausalityTools " ) For the latest development version of the package, add the package by referring directly to the GitHub repository. import Pkg; Pkg . add ( " https://github.com/kahaaga/CausalityTools.jl/ " ) Fixing SpecialFunction.jl error During installation, you might get an error related to SpecialFunctions.jl . If so, just run the following: Pkg . build ( " SpecialFunctions " ) Then run using CausalityTools to verify that everything works.
