ConsistencyResampling.jl Consistency resampling of calibrated predictions. Overview This package implements consistency resampling in the Julia language, as described by Bröcker and Smith (2007) . It is based on the Bootstrap.jl package for statistical bootstrapping in Julia. Consistency resampling is a resampling technique that generates calibrated predictions from a data set of predictions and corresponding labels. First a set of predictions is sampled from the data set with replacement. In a second step artificial labels are sampled with the predicted probabilities. This resampling procedure ensures that the predictions are calibrated for the artificial labels. Example The predictions have to be provided as a matrix of size (m, n) , in which each of the n columns corresponds to predicted probabilities of the labels 1,…,m . The corresponding labels have to be provided as a vector of length n , in which every element is from the set 1,…,m . using Distributions predictions = rand ( Dirichlet ( 10 , 1 ), 500 ) labels = rand ( 1 : 10 , 500 ) Consistency resampling is performed similar to the other bootstrapping approaches in Bootstrap.jl . A random number generator can be provided as optional argument. using ConsistencyResampling using Distances using Flux : onehotbatch b = bootstrap ((predictions, labels), ConsistentSampling ( 100_000 )) do (x, y) totalvariation (x, onehotbatch (y, 1 : 10 )) / 500 end The bootstrapped samples can be explored and used for estimation of confidence intervals, as explained in the documentation of Bootstrap.jl .
