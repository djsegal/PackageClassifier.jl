OrderedCollections.jl This package implements OrderedDicts and OrderedSets, which are similar to containers in base Julia. However, during iteration the Ordered* containers return items in the order in which they were added to the collection. It also implements LittleDict which is a ordered dictionary, that is much faster than any other AbstractDict (ordered or not) for small collections. This package was split out from DataStructures.jl . Resources Documentation : https://juliacollections.github.io/OrderedCollections.jl/latest
