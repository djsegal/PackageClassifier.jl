Build Status ProxSDP is an open-source semidefinite programming ( SDP ) solver based on the paper "Exploiting Low-Rank Structure in Semidefinite Programming by Approximate Operator Splitting" . The main advantage of ProxSDP over other state-of-the-art solvers is the ability to exploit the low-rank structure inherent to several SDP problems. Overview of problems ProxSDP can solve General conic convex optimization problems with the presence of the positive semidefinite cone , second-order cone and positive orthant ; Semidefinite relaxation of nonconvex problems, e.g. max-cut , binary MIMO , optimal power flow , sensor localization , sum-of-squares ; Control theory problems with LMI constraints; Nuclear norm minimization problems, e.g. matrix completion ; Installation You can install ProxSDP through the Julia package manager : ] add ProxSDP Using ProxSDP with JuMP For example, consider the semidefinite programming relaxation of the max-cut problem max 0.25 * W•X s.t. diag(X) = 1, X ≽ 0, This problem can be solved by the following code using ProxSDP and JuMP . # Load packages using ProxSDP, JuMP, LinearAlgebra # Number of vertices n = 4 # Graph weights W = [ 18.0 - 5.0 - 7.0 - 6.0 - 5.0 6.0 0.0 - 1.0 - 7.0 0.0 8.0 - 1.0 - 6.0 - 1.0 - 1.0 8.0 ] # Build Max-Cut SDP relaxation via JuMP model = Model ( with_optimizer (ProxSDP .
