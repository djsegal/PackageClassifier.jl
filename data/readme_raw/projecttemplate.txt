ProjectTemplate.jl NOTICE This package is unmaintained. Its reliability is not guaranteed. Introduction ProjectTemplate.jl is a draft port of the ProjectTemplate package for R to Julia. It is still a work in progress. More importantly, many of the tools that make the R version of ProjectTemplate so powerful are still missing in Julia, especially those that allow ProjectTemplate to automatically read many complex file formats like Stata and SPSS files. Nevertheless, the package is usable. Creating a Project using ProjectTemplate createproject("MyFirstPackage") Working with an Existing Project using ProjectTemplate loadproject() # Assume that the first dataset was called dataset1 head(dataset1) # # The names of the autoloaded datasets are in project_info["data"] # # We can do some fancy metaprogramming to view the autoloaded datasets # for dataset in ProjectTemplate.project_info["data"] @eval printtable($(symbol(dataset))) end Translating a Project from R to Julia Place contents of config/global.dcf in config/global.json Translate all code inside of lib , munge and src into Julia Make CSV copies of all files stored using the RData format
