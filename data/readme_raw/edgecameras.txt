EdgeCameras.jl: Edge Cameras in Julia This project consists of an implementation of edge cameras based on the work of Bouman et al. [1]. An edge camera is formed when a sharp edge (such as the corner of a wall) creates a natural one-dimensonal pinhole camera, revealing the motions of objects which are completely obscured by the corner. More information from the original authors can be found at people.csail.mit.edu . This package consists of an entirely new implementation of the edge camera algorithm, based on the work presented in the paper, and done entirely in Julia (except for the raw video I/O, which is ultimately handled by ffmpeg ).
