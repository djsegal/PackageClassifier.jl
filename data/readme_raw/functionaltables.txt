FunctionalTables Julia package for working with (potentially large) columns of data. Design A table is a collection of columns , indexed by Symbol s. Columns are immutable , which allows compression and type narrowing when applicable. Columns do not support random access, just iterate . Columns are created by collecting elements into sinks , which are then finalized. While being collected into, sinks can change representation, eg decide whether to use RLE or other compression schemes, mmap to disk for large data, etc --- these can be configured and ideally ignored by the user. NamedTuple s are used pervasively throughout the interface. Status Heavily experimental, API changes radically without warnings or deprecations. This primarily an experiment, the package will be registered if it works out.
