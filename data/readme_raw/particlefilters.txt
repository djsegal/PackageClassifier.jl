ParticleFilters This package provides some simple generic particle filters, and may serve as a template for making custom particle filters and other belief updaters. It is compatible with POMDPs.jl, but does not have to be used with that package. Installation In Julia: Pkg . add ( " ParticleFilters " ) Usage Basic setup might look like this: using ParticleFilters, Distributions dynamics (x, u, rng) = x + u + randn (rng) y_likelihood (x_previous, u, x, y) = pdf ( Normal (), y - x) model = ParticleFilterModel {Float64} (dynamics, y_likelihood) pf = SIRParticleFilter (model, 10 ) Then the update function can be used to perform a particle filter update. b = ParticleCollection ([ 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 ]) u = 1.0 y = 3.0 b_new = update (pf, b, u, y) This is a very simple example and the framework can accommodate a variety of more complex use cases. More details can be found in the documentation linked to below. There are tutorials for three ways to use the particle filters: As an estimator for feedback control , to filter time-series measurements , and as an updater for POMDPs.jl .
