MicroCoverage MicroCoverage.jl is a code coverage tool for Julia, implemented in pure Julia. Installation julia > using Pkg; Pkg . add ( " MicroCoverage " ) Example Step 1: Create a file named foo.jl with the following contents: function foo (x) if x == 1 || x == 100 return " hello " else return " goodbye " end end Step 2: Create a file named test_foo.jl with the following contents: using Test @test foo ( 1 ) == " hello " Step 3: Open julia and run the following commands: julia > using MicroCoverage julia > MicroCoverage . start ( " foo.jl " ) julia > include ( " foo.jl " ) julia > include ( " test_foo.jl " ) julia > MicroCoverage . stop () When you run MicroCoverage.stop() , MicroCoverage will create a file named foo.jl.microcov with the following contents: [ 1 , 1 , 1 ] function foo (x) [ 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 ] if x == 1 || x == 100 [ 1 ] return " hello " - else [ 0 ] return " goodbye " - end - end - Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health grants U54GM115677, R01LM011963, and R25MH116440.
