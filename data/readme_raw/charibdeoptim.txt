CharibdeOptim This Julia package is for to solve mathematical optimisation problems of both unconstrained as well as constrained kind. The package uses the approach named Charibde in which it uses two parallel running algorithms Differential Evolution and Interval Branch & Contract algorithm to achieve solution of any difficult problem. The package makes these two algorithms run in parallel either on same worker (processor) or on two different workers while maintaining contact with one another through channels or remotechannels . The package also allows us to use just Interval Branch & Contract algorithm to solve the problems.. The package can also be used through JuMP syntax. Documentation Documentation for the package is available here . Example of some difficult problems are present in the Example folder.
