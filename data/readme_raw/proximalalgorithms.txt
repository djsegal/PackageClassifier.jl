ProximalAlgorithms.jl Proximal algorithms (also known as "splitting" algorithms or methods) for nonsmooth optimization in Julia. This package can be used in combination with ProximalOperators.jl (providing first-order primitives, i.e. gradient and proximal mapping, for numerous cost functions) and AbstractOperators.jl (providing several linear and nonlinear operators) to formulate and solve a wide spectrum of nonsmooth optimization problems. StructuredOptimization.jl provides a higher-level interface to formulate and solve problems using (some of) the algorithms here included. Quick start To install the package, simply issue the following command in the Julia REPL: ] add ProximalAlgorithms Check out these test scripts for examples on how to apply the provided algorithms to problems.
