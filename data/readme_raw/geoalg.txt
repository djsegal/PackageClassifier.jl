Geometric Algebra for Julia This is work-in-progress straight port of Fontijne's reference implementation of geometric algebra utilities to Julia. The code is right now mostly unperformant and non-idiomatic, but I try to improve it whenever I can. This project follows the license of the original implementation, GPL2. Things to do A list of things to do, in no particular order: Rewrite in idiomatic Julia Implement general_inverse and utility functions for Multivectors Support named basis vectors Maybe a builtin support for popular geometry models (conformal, hyperbolic, homogeneous etc) A comprehensive test suite cos() and sin() Multivector types meet and join (possibly using the new method described here A comprehensive benchmark to track performance improvements/regressions Travis-ci support? Write documentation Use BitArray for bitmaps instead of integers?
