PushVectors Implement a workaround for julia#24909 , using a suggestion by @KristofferC (code used with permission, modified by @tpapp, who is responsible for all bugs etc). Should I use this package? Probably not, unless push! to Vector is the bottleneck in your code. This is just a demonstration, and will be deprecated when the issue above is fixed. Overview The single exported type is PushVector , which can be push! ed to. Use finish! to shrink and obtain the final vector, but note that you should not use the original after that. julia > v = PushVector {Int} () 0 - element PushVector{Int64,Array{Int64, 1 }} julia > push! (v, 1 ) 1 - element PushVector{Int64,Array{Int64, 1 }} : 1 julia > finish! (v) 1 - element Array{Int64, 1 } : 1
