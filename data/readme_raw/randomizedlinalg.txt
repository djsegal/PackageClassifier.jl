RandomizedLinAlg.jl RandomizedLinAlg.jl is a Julia package that provides randomized algorithms for numerical linear algebra as advocated in [1]. This package was split off from IterativeSolvers.jl as randomized algorithms were not considered well-established and potentially unstable. See the manual for the available methods.
