SimpleRl.jl A bare-bones package for simulating and fitting RL models to data from bandit tasks. Installation Clone this repo and place it into your ~/.julia directory. Usage We simulate a TD-learner in a 3-bandit task with Bernoulli arms: using Distributions using SimpleRL alpha = 0.1 beta = 1.0 n_actions = 3 n_trials = 1_000 learner = TDLearner(alpha, beta, n_actions) environment = [Bernoulli(0.1), Bernoulli(0.2), Bernoulli(0.3)] history = Array(Float64, n_trials, 2) simulate!(learner, environment, n_trials, history) loglikelihood(history, alpha, beta) alpha_hat, beta_hat = fit(TDLearner, history)
