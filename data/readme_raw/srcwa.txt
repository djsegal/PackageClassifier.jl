SRCWA.jl Scatter-matrix Rigorously Coupled Wave Analysis implemented in Julia This solves Maxwell's equations for periodically patterned multilayers of optically isotropic materials, currently supporting the computation of reflection, transmission and layerwise absorption for arbitrary plane wave incidence. Usage Defining a reciprocal space grid using SRCWA Nx = Ny = 3 # maximum order of the reciprocal space vector in x and y nx,ny,dnx,dny = grid_n (Nx,Ny) # create grids in reciprocal space SRCWA solves Maxwell equtions in reciprocal space. All electric and magnetic fields are dealt with in terms of frequency $k_0$, reciprocal space x and y wavevector $k_x$ and $k_y$, and real space z coordinate $z$. Nx and Ny define the highes index of the reciprocal lattice vector, so Nx=0 gives only zeroth order and a one-element vector while Nx=1 gives the three-element vector (-1,0,1). Higher orders give higher accuracy in the result at the cost of higher computation time. When dealing with structures that are homeogenous in one or both lateral directions, the resulting order can be left at zero. Scaling the grid to the desired frequency and periodicity theta = 1E-5 # incident angle in degrees between propagation direction and surface normal phi = 0 # azimuth angle in degrees lambda = 1000 # wavelength ax = ay = 1000 # uni cell size in x and y epsilon_ref = 1 # reflection halfspace (space above the device) relative permittivity k0,Kx,Ky,kin = grid_k (nx,ny,theta,phi,lambda,ax,ay,epsilon_ref) In order to obtain the reciprocal lattice vectors, one has to define the incident wavelength and real space unit cell size and scale the grid by these. This RCWA implementation works for arbitrary plane wave incidence conditions. However, $\theta$ should not be set to zero in order to avoid numerical singularities. One can find a sufficiently small angle where other numerical errors overshadow the problem of imperfectly normal incidence. The choice of the length units for wavelength and cell size is arbitrary, but must be consistent. The returned values are the free-space wavevector aka frequency $k_0$ and diagonal matrices of the lateral reciprocal wave vectors Kx and Ky. kin is the incident wave vector required for the calculation of the normalized field components of the impinging plane wave. Reflection and Transmission halfspace epsilon_tra = 4 # transmission halfspace relative permittivity refspace = halfspace (Kx,Ky,epsilon_ref) # reflection halfspace effective impedance and modes traspace = halfspace (Kx,Ky,epsilon_tra) # transmission halfspace effective impedance and modes V0,Kz0 = modes_freespace (Kx,Ky) # free space effective impedance and modes for normalization Sref = matrix_ref (refspace,V0) # scattering matrix of the reflection halfspace Stra = matrix_tra (traspace,V0) # scattering matrix of the transmission halfspace Any SRCWA computation will require the scattering matrices of the halfspaces above (reflection) and below (transmission) the device of interest. They are modeled with zero thickness, corresponding to the measurement of the plane wave directly at the device, without additional propagation losses or phase shift. The computation is done in two steps. Firstly the effective impedance of the halfspaces is calculated, then it is normalized with that of free space. A minimal simulation model, which basically just yields the same as Fresnel's equation, is comprised of a transmission and reflection layer. Building a device layer by layer t1 = 100 # thickness, same units as wavelength eps1 = 2 # relative permittivity l1 = layer_plain (Kx,Ky,k0,t1,eps1) # compute modes of a plain layer S1 = matrix_layer (l1,V0) # compute the scattering matrix of l1 eps2a = 2 # permittivity inside the inclusion of layer 2 eps2b = 3 + 1im # permittivity outside the inclusion of layer 2 fill_x = fill_y = .5 # fill factor of inclusion in x and y F = circft (fill_x,dnx,dny) # Fourier transform of a circular inclusion in real space into reciprocal space F = ellipft (fill_x,fill_y,dnx,dny) # Fourier transform of an elliptic inclusion in real space into reciprocal space F = rectft (fill_x,fill_y,dnx,dny) # Fourier transform of a rectangular inclusion in real space into reciprocal space using LinearAlgebra eps2 = eps2a * F + eps2b * (I - F) # the permittivity distribution of layer 2 in reciprocal space t2 = 200 # thickness of layer 2 l2 = layer_patterned (Kx,Ky,k0,t2,eps2) # compute modes of a patterned layer S2 = matrix_layer (l2,V0) # compute the scattering matrix of l2 S = concatenate ([Sref,S1,S2,Stra]) Plain layers with a homogenous relative permittivity can be constructed in a simple way, similar to the transmission and reflection halfspaces. In addition to their different relative impedance, they incorporate absorption and phase shift. For patterned layers, the permittivity is given as a function of the reciprocal space vector, obtained by Fourier transform. This will make the waves different reciprocal lattice vectors propagate with different effective permittivities, and couple with each other at interfaces. The scattering matrix of the full device can then be obtained from the individual scattering matrices. Reflection and transmission a0te,a0tm = prepare_source (kin,refspace . W,Nx,Ny) # calculate the amplitudes of the impinging plane wave for te or tm polarization aRte = S .

S21 * a0tm # transmitted wave for incident TM Ttm = a2p (aTtm,traspace,Kx,Ky,kin[ 3 ]) # transmitted power for incident TM With the scattering matrix constructed, it is easy to compute transmitted and reflected wave amplitudes and power for TE and TM incident polarizations. Absorption Sabove = concatenate ([Sref,S1]) # scatter matrix of the layers above the layer of interest Sint = S2 # layer of interest Sbelow = Stra # scatter matrix of the layers below the layer of interest Ate = absorption (Sabove,Sint,Sbelow,V0,a0te,kin[ 3 ]) # Absorption in layer 2 for TE incidence Atm = absorption (Sabove,Sint,Sbelow,V0,a0tm,kin[ 3 ]) # Absorption in layer 2 for TM incidence This simple method calculates the absorption of a layer from the difference in the power of the electromagnetic wave entering and leaving the layer. Electric and magnetic fields realgrid = grid_xy_square ( 51 ) # create a grid in real space for the data Sabove = concatenate ([Sref,S1]) # scatter matrix of the layers above the layer of interest Sint = S2 # layer of interest Sbelow = Stra # scatter matrix of the layers below the layer of interest ain,aout,bin,bout = stackamp (Sabove,Sint,Sbelow,a0tm) # the amplitude vectors going into and out of the layer for tm incidence e1h = field_expansion (ain,aout,bin,bout,l2,V0, 100 ,Kx,Ky,Kz0,k0,nx,ny,realgrid) # calculate the fields in real space The actual electric and magnetic fields inside the layers can be computed from the amplitudes using the eigenmodes of the layers. For this, the amplitudes of the plane wave components are transformed into the eigenstates of the layer, in order to compute the amplitude at each z-component. This is then converted to the components of the electric and magnetic field and transformed to real space with a given grid. References D. M. Whittaker and I. S.
