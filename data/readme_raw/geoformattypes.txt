GeoFormatTypes GeoFormatTypes defines wrapper types to make it easy to pass Geographic formats like WellKnownText or GeoJSON between packages while keeping information about what format is contained - instead of passing a String or Int that could be from any type. Wrapper types also allow methods such as convert to work with data in multiple formats, instead of defining lists of format-specific handling methods.
