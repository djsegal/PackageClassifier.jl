IntervalSets.jl Interval Sets for Julia This package represents intervals of an ordered set. For an interval spanning from a to b , all values x that lie between a and b are defined as being members of the interval. This package is intended to implement a "minimal" foundation for intervals upon which other packages might build. In particular, we encourage type-piracy for the reason that only one interval package can unambiguously define the .. and ± operators (see below). Currently this package defines one concrete type, ClosedInterval . These define the closed set spanning from a to b , meaning the interval is defined as the set {x} satisfying a ≤ x ≤ b . This is sometimes written [a,b] (mathematics syntax, not Julia syntax) or a..b . Usage You can construct ClosedInterval s in a variety of ways: julia > using IntervalSets julia > ClosedInterval {Float64} ( 1 , 3 ) 1.0 .. 3.0 julia > 0.5 .. 2.5 0.5 .. 2.5 julia > 1.5 ± 1 0.5 .. 2.5 Similarly, you can construct OpenInterval s and Interval{:open,:closed} s, and Interval{:closed,:open} : julia > OpenInterval {Float64} ( 1 , 3 ) 1.0 .. 3.0 (open) julia > OpenInterval ( 0.5 .. 2.5 ) 0.5 .. 2.5 (open) julia > Interval {:open,:closed} ( 1 , 3 ) 1..3 (open–closed) The ± operator may be typed as \pm<TAB> (using Julia's LaTeX syntax tab-completion). Intervals also support the expected set operations: julia > 1.75 ∈ 1.5 ± 1 # \in<TAB>; can also use `in` true julia > 0 ∈ 1.5 ± 1 false julia > 1 ∈ OpenInterval ( 0..1 ) false julia > intersect ( 1..5 , 3..7 ) # can also use `a ∩ b`, where the symbol is \cap<TAB> 3..5 julia > isempty ( intersect ( 1..5 , 10..11 )) true julia > ( 0.25 .. 5 ) ∪ ( 3..7.4 ) # \cup<TAB>; can also use union() 0.25 .. 7.4 When computing the union, the result must also be an interval: julia > ( 0.25 .. 5 ) ∪ ( 6..7.4 ) ------ ArgumentError ------------------- Stacktrace (most recent call last) [ 1 ] — union ( :: IntervalSets.ClosedInterval{Float64} , :: IntervalSets.ClosedInterval{Float64} ) at closed . jl : 34 ArgumentError : Cannot construct union of disjoint sets.
