SenseHat.jl SenseHat.jl is a Julia library for interacting with the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT . SenseHat.jl requires the Raspbian sense-hat package: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install sense-hat sudo reboot LED matrix The main interface is the led_matrix() function, which creates an 8Ã—8 array of RGB values (from ColorTypes.jl ) which is memory-mapped to the frame buffer of the LED matrix. led_clear() is a convenience function for resetting the LED matrix to black. using SenseHat using ColorTypes const LED = led_matrix () LED[:] = SenseHat . JULIA_LOGO sleep ( 3 ) led_clear () Joystick In the Stick module there is readstick() which will block until the joystick is manipulated, returning a StickEvent : using SenseHat e = readstick () For querying within a loop, use a Channel to create a buffer of StickEvent . using SenseHat c = Channel {StickEvent} ( 32 ) @async while true put! (c, readstick ()) end Sensors humidity() , temperature() and pressure() will read values from the corresponding sensors. The inertial measurement unit (IMU) is not yet supported, but is coming soon. In the meantime, you can use the python library via PyCall.jl .
