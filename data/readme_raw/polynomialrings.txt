PolynomialRings Build Status Test coverage A library for arithmetic and algebra with multi-variable polynomials. Usage using PolynomialRings R = @ring! ℚ[x,y] if (x + y) * (x - y) == x ^ 2 - y ^ 2 println ( " Seems to work " ) end A few useful functions are deg , expansion , groebner_basis . Use divrem and friends for doing reduction w.r.t. Gröbner bases. Want to know more? Have a look at the getting started guide . Maturity Currently, this library should be considered alpha quality.
