CSFML Julia wrapper for CSFML , the official binding of SFML for C. SFML is a simple, fast, cross-platform and object-oriented multimedia API. It provides access to windowing, graphics, audio and network. The Julia bindings in this repo are auto-generated using Clang.jl . You could refer to CSFML's repo for how to use those bindings. Installation pkg > add CSFML On Linux, you might need to install the following dependencies firstly: openal pthread opengl xlib xrandr udev freetype flac vorbis Should you encountered any installation problems, feel free to file an issue. Quick start using CSFML .
