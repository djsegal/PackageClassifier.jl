A Julia interface to the XPA messaging system This Julia package provides an interface to the XPA Messaging System for seamless communication between many kinds of Unix/Windows programs, including X programs and Tcl/Tk programs. For instance, this message system is used for some popular astronomical tools such as SAOImage-DS9 . XPA.jl can be used to send commands and data to XPA servers, to query data from XPA servers or to implement an XPA server. The interface exploits the power of ccall to directly call the routines of the compiled XPA library. Documentation License Travis-CI CoverAlls CodeCov Devel
