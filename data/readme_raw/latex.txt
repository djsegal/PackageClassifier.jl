LaTeX This package allows to construct LaTeX documents programmatically. Installation It is assumed that you have pdflatex installed. You can then install LaTeX.jl like this: ]add LaTeX To be able to use code blocks with syntax highlighting, please install Pygments : easy_install -U Pygments . Example using LaTeX x = range ( - 6 , 6 ; length = 100 ) using Gadfly g = Image ( 7 , 7 , plot (x = x, y = sin .(x) ./ x, Geom . line)) w = Image ( 7 , 7 , plot (x = x, y = cos .(x))) # needs pygments to be installed c = Code ( """ struct MyJuliaType a::Array{Int} end """ ) openpdf ( report ( Section ( " Results " , [ Section ( " Plots " , Figure ( " Plot comparison " , Tabular ([w,g]))), Section ( " Code " , c) ]))) Available functions content can always be either a single item or an array of items. latex = report(content) assembles the LaTeX file latex = document(content) gives more control over the look and feel of the document. See here for more. openpdf(latex) compiles the LaTeX file and tries to open it writepdf(latex, filename) compiles the LaTeX file and save it to the destination provided Section(title, content) creates a new section. A section is automatically translated to a Linux chapter, section or subsection according to its nesting Figure(caption, content) Table(caption content) Tabular(content) Code(content) TOC() indicates a table of contents Abstract(content) defines an abstract for the document Image(height, width, Array or Winston.FramePlot or Gadfly.Plot) , where the array can be either of size (m,n,1) or RGB (m,n,3) , with the values in the range 0..1 Advanced To define a custom document, use the document function, in combination with the following declarations, some of which can be omitted: DocumentClass("article", ["11pt", "letterpaper"]) declares the document class of the file. Settings are passed through a vector as the second parameter. Title("A LaTeX Library for Julia") declares the title of the file. Date(1999, 12, 31) declares the date of the file. Note that this is the same Date as in standard Julia. Author("John Smith") declares the author of the file. For example, the following is a minimal document: document([ DocumentClass("article", ["11pt", "letterpaper"]), Date(2015, 11, 23), Title("A LaTeX Library for Julia"), Author("John Smith"), Section("Code", [Code("""# minimal example""")])]) Todos make preamble configurable adapt openpdf to linux add tests
