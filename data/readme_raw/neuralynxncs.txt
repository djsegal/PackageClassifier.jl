NeuralynxNCS This is a Julia module for reading Neuralynx NCS files. You can read files as: readncs ( " CSC1.Ncs " ) The output is an object: immutable NCSContinuousChannel header :: ByteString samples :: Vector{Int16} times :: PiecewiseIncreasingRange{Float64,StepRange{Int64,Int64},Int64} end At present it supports only a single channel per file, because this is how all the NCS files I have are structured. See PiecewiseIncreasingRanges.jl for some more information on how to use times .
