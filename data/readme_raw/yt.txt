These include: Loading of yt datasets Some basic yt data objects, such as spheres, regions, covering grids, projections, slices, etc. Creating in-memory datasets ( load_uniform_grid , load_amr_grids , etc.) Profile objects Slice and projection plots Symbolic units, YTArrays, YTQuantities YT version 0.4 can be installed in Julia version 0.5 or higher. To install it, just run: Pkg.add("YT") which will also install the following dependencies (if you don't already have them): PyCall PyPlot SymPy However, for YT to work, yt itself must be installed. YT version 0.4 requires yt version 3.3.1 or higher. The best ways to install yt are via the install script or via the Anaconda Python Distribution . Once YT is installed, either julia> import YT to use it as a library, or julia> using YT to use it as an application, loading its methods into the current session's namespace.
