ElectronDisplay Overview This package provides a display for figures and plots. When you load the package, it will push a new display onto the julia display stack and from then on it will display any value that can be rendered as png, svg, vega, vega-lite or plotly in an electron based window. This is especially handy when one works on the REPL and wants plots to show up in a nice window. Getting Started You can install the package via the normal julia package manger: Pkg . add ( " ElectronDisplay " ) As soon as you load the package with using ElectronDisplay , it will start to show plots that have the correct show methods in an electron window. ElectronDisplay also exports a function electrondisplay . You can use electrondisplay(x) to show x explicitly in ElectronDisplay (e.g., when another display has higher precedence). You can also use electrondisplay(mime, x) to specify a MIME to be used. For example, to read the docstring of reduce in ElectronDisplay , you can use electrondisplay(@doc reduce) . Configuration You can use the following configuration option to reuse existing window for displaying a new content. The default behavior is to create a new window for each display. using ElectronDisplay ElectronDisplay . CONFIG . single_window = true To control objects to be handled by ElectronDisplay , you can set ElectronDisplay.CONFIG.showable . By default, ElectronDisplay does not show markdown, HTML, and application/vnd.dataresource+json output. To show everything in ElectronDisplay whenever it's supported, you can use: ElectronDisplay . CONFIG . showable = showable To override the default configuration temporary, use the keyword arguments to electrondisplay : electrondisplay ( @doc reduce; single_window = true , focus = false )
