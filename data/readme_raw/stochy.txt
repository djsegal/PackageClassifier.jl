Stochy.jl Stochy is a probabilistic programming language embedded within Julia. Models are specified using a functional subset of Julia, and inference can be performed by exhaustive enumeration, PMCMC 1 or Metropolis-Hastings 2 . The implementation follows the approach described in The Design and Implementation of Probabilistic Programming Languages . Status This project is no longer under development. If you're looking for an actively maintained and more fully featured system you might take a look at WebPPL . (Stochy is basically a half-finished Julia port of WebPPL.) You'll find many more alternatives in this list of probabilistic programming systems .
