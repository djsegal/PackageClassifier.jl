ParquetFiles Overview This package provides load support for Parquet files under the FileIO.jl package. Installation Use ] add ParquetFiles in Julia to install ParquetFiles and its dependencies. Usage Load a Parquet file To read a Parquet file into a DataFrame , use the following julia code: using ParquetFiles, DataFrames df = DataFrame ( load ( " data.parquet " )) The call to load returns a struct that is an IterableTable.jl , so it can be passed to any function that can handle iterable tables, i.e. all the sinks in IterableTable.jl . Here are some examples of materializing a Parquet file into data structures that are not a DataFrame : using ParquetFiles, IndexedTables, TimeSeries, Temporal, VegaLite # Load into an IndexedTable it = IndexedTable ( load ( " data.parquet " )) # Load into a TimeArray ta = TimeArray ( load ( " data.parquet " )) # Load into a TS ts = TS ( load ( " data.parquet " )) # Plot directly with Gadfly @vlplot ( :point , data = load ( " data.parquet " ), x = :a , y = :b ) Using the pipe syntax load also support the pipe syntax. For example, to load a Parquet file into a DataFrame , one can use the following code: using ParquetFiles, DataFrame df = load ( " data.parquet " ) |> DataFrame The pipe syntax is especially useful when combining it with Query.jl queries, for example one can easily load a Parquet file, pipe it into a query, then pipe it to the save function to store the results in a new file.
