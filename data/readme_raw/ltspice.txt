LTspice.jl LTspice.jl provides a julia interface to LTspice TM . Several interfaces are provided. A dictionary like interface to access parameters and measurements by name. An array interface, which is primarily for measurements of stepped simulations. Simulations can be called like functions. Documentation Installation LTspice.jl is currently unregistered. It can be installed using Pkg.clone . Pkg . clone ( " https://github.com/cstook/LTspice.jl.git " ) The julia documentation section on installing unregistered packages provides more information. LTspice.jl is compatible with julia 1.0 Example 1 Import the module. using LTspice Create an instance of LTspiceSimulation. example1 = LTspiceSimulation ( " example1.asc " ,tempdir = true ) Access parameters and measurements using their name as the key. Set a parameter to a new value. example1[ " Rload " ] = 20.0 # set parameter Rload to 20.0 Read the resulting measurement. loadpower = example1[ " Pload " ] # run simulation, return Pload Circuit can be called like a function loadpower = example1 ( 100.0 ) # pass Rload, return Pload Use Optim.jl to perform an optimization on a LTspice simulation using Optim result = optimize (rload -> - example1 (rload)[ 1 ], 10.0 , 100.0 ) rload_for_maximum_power = example1[ " Rload " ] Supported Platforms LTspice.jl works on windows and linux with LTspice under wine. Osx is not supported. Additional Information Latest documentation is here . Introduction to LTspice.jl The Linear Technology TM website The LTspice Yahoo Group LTwiki
