FTPClient.jl A Julia FTP client using LibCURL supporting FTP and FTP over SSL. Examples Depending on the settings of the FTP server you are connecting to you may need to deal with various security settings. FTP with no Transport Layer Security (FTP). Typically uses port 21/TCP. julia > ftp = FTP (hostname = " example.com " , username = " user " , password = " 1234 " ) URL : ftp : // user : ***** @example . com / Transfer : passive mode Security : none julia > ftp = FTP ( " ftp://user:1234@example.com " ) URL : ftp : // user : ***** @example . com / Transfer : passive mode Security : none FTP with implicit security (FTPS). Typically uses port 990/TCP. julia > ftp = FTP (hostname = " example.com " , username = " user " , password = " 1234 " , ssl = true , implicit = true ) URL : ftps : // user : ***** @example . com / Transfer : passive mode Security : implicit julia > ftp = FTP ( " ftps://user:1234@example.com " ) URL : ftps : // user : ***** @example . com / Transfer : passive mode Security : implicit FTP with explicit security (FTPES). Typically uses port 21/TCP. julia > ftp = FTP (hostname = " example.com " , username = " user " , password = " 1234 " , ssl = true , implicit = false ) URL : ftpes : // user : ***** @example . com / Transfer : passive mode Security : explicit julia > ftp = FTP ( " ftpes://user:1234@example.com " ) URL : ftpes : // user : ***** @example . com / Transfer : passive mode Security : explicit Once you've created your FTP instance you can use many of the filesystem functions that Julia provides. A quick example showing some of the functions available: julia > cd (ftp, " Documents/School " ) julia > pwd (ftp) " /Documents/School " julia > readdir (ftp) 1 - element Array{String, 1 } : " Assignment1.txt " " Assignment2.txt " julia > io = download (ftp, " Assignment1.txt " ); # Download as IO stream julia > download (ftp, " Assignment2.txt " , " ./A2/Assignment2.txt " ); # Save file to a specified path julia > upload (ftp, " Assignment3.txt " , " . " ) # Upload local file "Assignment3.txt" to FTP server home directory julia > open ( " Assignment3.txt " ) do fp upload (ftp, fp, " Assignment3-copy.txt " ) # Upload IO content as file "Assignment3-copy.txt" on FTP server end julia > mv (ftp, " Assignment3-copy.txt " , " Assignment3-dup.txt " ) julia > rm (ftp, " Assignment3-dup.txt " ) julia > mkdir (ftp, " tmp " ) julia > rmdir (ftp, " tmp " ) julia > close (ftp) If you want to upload a file but retry on failures you can do the following: julia > ftp_retry = retry (delays = fill ( 5.0 , 3 )) do upload (ftp, " Assignment3.txt " , " . " ) end julia > ftp_retry () FAQ Downloaded files are unusable Try downloading file in both binary and ASCII mode to see if one of the files is usable. Linux and Travis CI Travis CI currently [does not reliably support FTP connections on sudo-enabled Linux] https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-07-23-the-tale-of-ftp-at-travis-ci ). This will usually manifest itself as a Connection Timeout error. Disable sudo for a workaround.
