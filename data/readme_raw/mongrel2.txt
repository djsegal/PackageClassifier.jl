#A Julia interface to Mongrel2 This package is deprecated. The Mongrel2 webserver hasn't turned out to be very popular, and Julia now has a native web server. Therefore, my current reccomendation is to use HTTPServer , fronted by an nginx or Apache2 reverse proxy Mongrel2.jl is a package that enables writing [Mongrel2] ( http://mongrel2.org/ ) handlers in the [Julia] ( http://julialang.org ) programming language. Installation Pkg . add ( " Mongrel2 " ) This will also install the dependent Julia packages: [ZMQ] ( https://github.com/aviks/ZMQ.jl ) and [JSON] ( https://github.com/JuliaLang/JSON.jl ) Install Mongrel2 and ZMQ libraries for your OS using your favourite package manager ##Usage Start Mongrel2 in the usual fashion with m2sh using a relevant configuration. [Example] ( https://raw.github.com/aviks/Mongrel2.jl/master/example/mongrel2.config ) load ( " Mongrel2 " ) using Mongrel2 t = run_server ( " 6DFF1523-C091-49B8-B635-598640E864B3 " , " tcp://127.0.0.1:9997 " , " tcp://127.0.0.1:9996 " ) while true (conn, req) = consume (t) response = " <html><body>Sender: $(req . sender_id) <br>ConnectionId: $(req . connection_id) <br> Path: $(req . path) <br>Headers: $( string (req . headers)) <br> Body: $(req . body) </html></body> " if is_disconnected (req); print ( " Disconnected $(req . connection_id) \n " ); continue ; end reply_http (conn, req, response); disconnect_client (conn,req); end Navigate to http://localhost:6767/handlertest/
