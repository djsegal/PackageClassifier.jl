XSteam for julia Immigrate By hzgzh Date: 2019-9-29 X Steam for julia is a implementation of the IAPWS IF97 standard formulation immigrate from XSteam for matlab By Magnus Holmgren, www.x-eng.com The steam tables are free and provided as is. We take no responsibilities for any errors in the code or damage thereby. You are free to use, modify and distribute the code as long as authorship is properly acknowledged. Please notify me at magnus@x-eng.com if the code is used in commercial applications. It provides accurate data for water and steam and mixtures of water and steam properties from 0 - 1000 bar and from 0 - 2000 deg C. The initial units of XSteam are SI units as denoted in this document. All functions however call unit conversion functions so the units can be easily changed. A text file with unit conversion functions for English units are enclosed with the file. Usage The XSteam code are used in the following way: Example: rho_pT(1,200) returns the density at 1 bar and 200°C. winsteam syntax pth(1,200) returns the entalpy at 1bar and 200°C Introduction X Steam for matlab is a implementation of the IAPWS IF97 standard formulation. It provides accurate thermo hydraulic data for water and steam and mixtures of water and steam in the region: 0°C < temperature < 2000°C for 0.00611 bar a < pressure < 100 bar a 0°C < temperature < 1000°C for 0.00611 bar a < pressure < 1000 bar a For accuracy and further information on IAPWS IF97 formulation, se homepage of the international association for properties of water and steam ( www.iapws.org ).
