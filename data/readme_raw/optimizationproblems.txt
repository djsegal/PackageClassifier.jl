OptimizationProblems A collection of optimization problems in JuMP syntax. Installing OptimizationProblems can be installed and tested through the Julia package manager: julia > ] pkg > add OptimizationProblems pkg > test OptimizationProblems You can obtain the list of problems currently defined with names(OptimizationProblems) . The first symbol in the list is :OptimizationProblems itselfâ€“the name of the module. Currently, only a few unconstrained problems are implemented. Some are available in variable size. This module is particularly useful in conjunction with NLPModels to facilitate evaluating objective, constraints and their derivatives. Contributing Please open pull requests to submit new problems! When submitting a problem, please pay particular attention to the documentation. We would like to gather as much information as possible on the provenance of problems.
