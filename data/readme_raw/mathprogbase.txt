MathProgBase This package is deprecated in favor of MathOptInterface . This package provides high-level one-shot functions for linear and mixed-integer programming ( linprog and mixintprog ), as well as a solver-independent low-level interface for implementing advanced techniques that require efficiently solving a sequence of linear programming problems. See JuliaOpt.org for an up-to-date list of supported solvers. The interface is fully documented here .
