BlossomV.jl This package provides a julia wrapper to the Blossom V software package which provides an implementation of a minimum cost perfect matching algorithm. Blossom V is available under http://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software.html The algorithm is described in Blossom V: A new implementation of a minimum cost perfect matching algorithm. Vladimir Kolmogorov. In Mathematical Programming Computation (MPC), July 2009, 1(1):43-67. The Wrapper provided in this package is very simplistic, a nicer interface will be provided in future versions. There are several things you can do that will cause it to segfault -- often causing julia to segfault. Building You can install the package with the usual ]add BlossomV . A common thing that goes wrong is not having current enough version of C++ and its stdlibs. Currently the minimum requirements are a compiler supporting the C++11 standard (e.g. gcc-4.6 on ubuntu 12.04, or newer, should be recent enough). LICENSE This wrapper library is provided under the terms given in the license . Be aware that the code of the actual BlossomV library itself underlies a different license. It is up to you to check, whether or not that license is acceptable for your usage.
