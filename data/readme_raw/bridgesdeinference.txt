BridgeSDEInference.jl MCMC sampler for inference for diffusion processes with the use of Guided Proposals using the package Bridge.jl . Currently under development. Overview The main function introduced by this package is mcmc (setup) It finds the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters given discrete time observations of the underlying process. Please see the documentation (in development) . Installation Use the built-in package manager using Pkg Pkg . add ( " BridgeSDEInference " ) Future direction This package is currently under development, some of the features that are scheduled to be introduced to a package are: Gradient based proposals (for parameter and initial state updates) Support for mixed-effects models GPU support for efficient treatment of high-dimensional examples see issue #18 (TODOs) for an up-to-date list of planned tasks Contributing Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome.
