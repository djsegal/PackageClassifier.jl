Bridge.jl Statistics and stochastic calculus for Markov processes in continuous time, include univariate and multivariate stochastic processes such as stochastic differential equations or diffusions (SDE's) or Levy processes. I am personally interested in doing Bayesian inference on discretely observed diffusion processes, but this package is written to be of general use and contributions are welcome. Specifically for our code for parameter inference for diffusion processes from discrete data or passage times, check out the dependent package BridgeSDEInference.jl . The statistical method relies a lot on simulating conditional diffusions (so called "difffusion bridges"). See ./example/tutorial.jl for a more general introduction into working with this package. Define and simulate diffusion processes in one or more dimension Continuous and discrete likelihood using Girsanovs theorem and transition densities Monte Carlo sample diffusion bridges, diffusion processes conditioned to hit a point v at a prescribed time T Brownian motion in one and more dimensions Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridges Bessel processes Gamma processes Inhomogenous poisson process Basic stochastic calculus functionality (Ito integral, quadratic variation) Euler-Scheme and implicit methods (Runge-Kutta) Levy-driven SDEs Continuous-discrete filtering for partially observed diffusion processes The layout/api was originally written to be compatible with Simon Danisch's package FixedSizeArrays.jl . It was refactored to be compatible with StaticArrays.jl by Dan Getz. Some SDE and ODE solvers in Bridge are accessible with the JuliaDiffEq common interface via BridgeDiffEq.jl . The example programs in the example/ directory have additional dependencies: ConjugatePriors and a plotting library. Introduction The key objects introduced are the abstract type ContinuousTimeProcess{T} parametrised by the state space of the path, for example T == Float64 and various structs suptyping it, for example Wiener{Float64} for a real Brownian motion. These play roughly a similar role as types subtyping Distribution in the Distributions.jl package. Secondly, the struct struct SamplePath{T} tt :: Vector{Float64} yy :: Vector{T} SamplePath {T} (tt, yy) where {T} = new (tt, yy) end serves as container for sample path returned by direct and approximate samplers ( sample , euler , ...). tt is the vector of the grid points of the simulation and yy the corresponding vector of states. Help is available at the REPL: help?> GammaProcess search: GammaProcess LocalGammaProcess VarianceGammaProcess GammaProcess A GammaProcess with jump rate γ and inverse jump size λ has increments Gamma(t*γ, 1/λ) and Levy measure ν(x) = γ x⁻¹ exp(-λ x), Here Gamma(α,θ) is the Gamma distribution in julia's parametrization with shape parameter α and scale θ . Examples julia> sample(linspace(0.0, 1.0), GammaProcess(1.0, 0.5)) Pre-defined processes defined are Wiener , WienerBridge , Gamma , LinPro (linear diffusion/generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) and others. It is also quite transparent how to add a new process: using Bridge using Plots # Define a diffusion process struct OrnsteinUhlenbeck <: ContinuousTimeProcess{Float64} β :: Float64 # drift parameter (also known as inverse relaxation time) σ :: Float64 # diffusion parameter end # define drift and diffusion coefficient of OrnsteinUhlenbeck Bridge . b (t, x, P :: OrnsteinUhlenbeck ) = - P . β * x Bridge . σ(t, x, P :: OrnsteinUhlenbeck ) = P . σ # simulate OrnsteinUhlenbeck using Euler scheme W = sample ( 0 : 0.01 : 10 , Wiener ()) X = solve ( EulerMaruyama (), 0.1 , W, OrnsteinUhlenbeck ( 2.0 , 1.0 )) plot (X, label = " X " ) # Levy (Difference-Gamma process) driven OrnsteinUhlenbeck Z = sample ( 0 : 0.01 : 10 , GammaProcess ( 100.0 , 10.0 )) Z . yy .- = sample ( 0 : 0.01 : 10 , GammaProcess ( 100.0 , 10.0 )) . yy Y = solve ( EulerMaruyama (), 0.1 , Z, OrnsteinUhlenbeck ( 2.0 , 1.0 )) plot (Y, label = " Y " ) Feedback and Contributing See the documentation for more functionality and issue #12 (Feedback and Contribution) for coordination of the development.
