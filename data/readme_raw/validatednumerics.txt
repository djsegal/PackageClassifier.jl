ValidatedNumerics.jl ValidatedNumerics.jl is a suite of Julia packages for performing Validated Numerics in Julia, i.e. rigorous computations with finite-precision floating-point arithmetic, using interval arithmetic : quantities are treated as intervals that are propagated throughout a calculation. The final result is an interval that is guaranteed to contain the correct result, starting from the given initial data. The aims of the package are both correctness and good performance. Installation To install the package, from within Julia do julia > Pkg . add ( " ValidatedNumerics " ) Since version 0.9, ValidatedNumerics.jl is a meta-package that automatically installs and reexports the following packages from the JuliaIntervals GitHub organization : IntervalArithmetic.jl : arithmetic and elementary functions on intervals IntervalRootFinding.jl : find roots of multidimensional functions in a guaranteed way IntervalOptimisation.jl : guaranteed global optimisation of multidimensional functions IntervalConstraintProgramming.jl : characterization of feasible sets of equations and inequalities via constraint propagation IntervalContractors.jl : contractors and reverse (or inverse) functions Documentation Documentation is available separately for each of the above packages. IEEE Standard 1788-2015 - IEEE Standard for Interval Arithmetic The IEEE Std 1788-2015 - IEEE Standard for Interval Arithmetic was published in June 2015. We are working towards having ValidatedNumerics be conformant with this standard. To do so, we have incorporated tests from the excellent ITF1788 test suite , originally written by Marco Nehmeier and Maximilian Kiesner, and converted to a common format and to output tests for Julia by Oliver Heimlich.

History This project was begun during a masters' course in the postgraduate programs in Physics and in Mathematics at UNAM during the second semester of 2013 (in Python -- the ValidiPy package ), and was reinitiated -- now in Julia -- in the first semester of 2015. We thank the participants of the courses for putting up with the half-baked material and contributing energy and ideas.
