StringBuilders Overview A simple type for building up String s. Use as follows: using StringBuilders sb = StringBuilder () append! (sb, " First string " ) append! (sb, " Second string " ) s = String (sb) The advantage of StringBuilders.jl over using IOBuffer is in the API. Some may find The higher-level StringBuilders.jl API easier to use. For comparison, the example above using IOBuffer would be io = IOBuffer () write (io, " First string " ) write (io, " Second String " ) s = String ( take! (io)) close (io)
