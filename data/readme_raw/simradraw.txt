SimradRaw Simrad echosounder RAW file format reader in Julia Introduction Simrad scientific echosounders such as EK60, EK80 and WBT save their data in datagram oriented, RAW format files as described in the reference manuals. This Julia library reads RAW format files, returning their contents as a series of Julia structs representing datagrams. It is intended to be used by higher level libraries such as https://github.com/EchoJulia/SimradEK60.jl , that interprete the data to provide matrices of volume backscatter etc. Getting started using SimradRaw using SimradEK60TestData filename = EK60_SAMPLE # or some other RAW file datagrams = SimradRaw.load(filename) Also see the example scripts\rawcat.jl , a command line program that dumps out RAW files in a somewhat readable format.
