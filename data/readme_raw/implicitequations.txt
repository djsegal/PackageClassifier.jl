Linux: Windows: ImplicitEquations In a paper, Tupper presents a method for graphing two-dimensional implicit equations and inequalities. This package gives an implementation of the paper's basic algorithms to allow the Julia user to naturally represent and easily render graphs of implicit functions and equations. We give one example, others may be viewed as an IJulia notebook ( here ). The Devils curve is graphed over the default region as follows: using Plots pyplot() using ImplicitEquations a,b = -1,2 f(x,y) = y^4 - x^4 + a*y^2 + b*x^2 plot(f â©µ 0) # \Equal[tab]
