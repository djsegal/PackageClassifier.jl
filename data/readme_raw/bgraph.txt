BGraph An adjacency list that uses typed properties for vertices, edges, and graphs. This is not ready for others to use. It implements an adjacency list with a choice of containers for vertices and for out edge lists. It seems to ask too much regularity from Julia's container classes, too much clarity about what is an index or iterator, and too much customizability from Julia's type system. Look in the documentation section for discussion.
