Harlequin is a Julia package that simulates the operations of a space mission measuring the CMB. The program includes the following basic features: Generation of pointing information; Simulation of the CMB dipolar signal; Production of maps. If you are looking for a more mature and comprehensive toolkit, which includes several more features, be sure to have a look at TOAST . This includes a full-scale map-maker (MADAM), beam convolution, half-wave plate simulation, atmospheric effects (useful for ground experiments). Moreover, it uses Python instead of Julia, and it is much better supported on HPC superclusters. A few advantages of Harlequin over TOAST are the following: It works under Linux, Mac, and Windows; It strives to have comprehensive documentation; It can use the Julia ecosystem, including awesome tools as plot recipes , interactive widgets , error propagation , etc. Installation Start the julia prompt and run the following commands: import Pkg Pkg . add ( " Harlequin " ) Documentation It is available both for the stable and dev branches.
