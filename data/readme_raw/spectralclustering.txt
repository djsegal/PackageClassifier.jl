SpectralClustering Documentation Check out the Examples The library provides functions that allow: Build the affinity matrix. Perform the embedding of the patterns in the space spanned by the eigenvectors of the matrices derived from the affinity matrix. Obtain an approximation of the eigenvectors in order to reduce the computational complexity. Exploiting information from multiple views. Corresponding nodes in each graph should have the same cluster membership. Clusterize the eigenvector space. Methods implemented Graph construction Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering Embedding Normalized cuts and image segmentation On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm Understanding Popout through Repulsion Segmentation Given Partial Grouping Constraints Approximate embedding Spectral grouping using the nystrom method Nystrom sampling depends on the eigenspectrum shape of the data Large Scale Spectral Clustering with Landmark-Based Representation Multiple views Kernel Addition Kernel Product Feature Concatenation (in the examples section) Co-regularized Multi-view Spectral Clustering Incremental TODO Incremental spectral clustering by efficiently updating the eigen-system Clusterize Multiclass Spectral Clustering KMeans via Clustering.jl The documentation and the library is still a work in progress.
