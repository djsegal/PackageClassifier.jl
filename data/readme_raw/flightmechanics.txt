FlightMechanics Flight Mechanics utils ✈️ ⚠️ This package is in its initial development phase 🚧 This package is intended to provide utils for Flight Mechanics computations. It runs on julia ≥ 1.0 International Standard Atmosphere: get pressure, temperature, density, sound velocity for a given altitude. Conversion between different coordinate systems: body horizon wind ECEF llh (latitude, longitude, height) over various ellipsoid models Quaternion and euler angles conversions Anemometry: conversion between tas, cas, eas. velocity calculation from airspeed indicator (ASI) pressure difference dynamic pressure calculation (compressible and incompressible cases) tas, alpha, beta from body velocity 6 DOF Dynamic fixed mass models: Flat Earth Euler angles Flat Earth quaternions Ellipsoidal Earth ECEF model quaternion An experimental version of the simulator has been started. At the moment it comprises: C310 aerodynamics model obtained from JSBSim with an oversimplified engine model. F16 aerodynamics and engine (except for engine lag) model from ([1]). A preliminary version of the trimmer able to trim both aircrafts and validated for F16 with text book examples. Some base models serving as a for the development of the simulator: state, position, attitude, aerostate, mass, propulsion... > [1] Stevens, B. L., Lewis, F. L., & Johnson, E. N. (2015).
