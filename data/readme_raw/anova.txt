Analysis of Variance in Julia Calculate ANOVA tables for linear models. If no anovatype argument is provided, a type III ANOVA will be calculated. Type I and II are also supported for compatibility. Support for mixed models and a more convenient way to create ANOVAs (similar to the ez package in R) is planned. Important: Make sure to use EffectsCoding on all your predictors, or results won't be meaningful. Minimal Example: using RDatasets, GLM, ANOVA data = dataset ( " datasets " , " ToothGrowth " ) categorical! (data, :Dose ) model = fit (LinearModel, @formula (Len ~ Supp + Dose), data, contrasts = Dict ( :Supp => EffectsCoding (), :Dose => EffectsCoding ())) Anova (model) ANOVA table for linear model DF SS MSS F p Supp 1.0 205.35 205.35 14.0166 0.0004 Dose 2.0 2426.43 1213.22 82.8109 < 1e-16 Residuals 56.0 820.425 14.6504 0.0 < 1e-99
