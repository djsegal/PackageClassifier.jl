RemoteSemaphores Documentation RemoteSemaphore (n :: Int , pid = myid ()) A RemoteSemaphore is a counting semaphore that lives on a particular process in order to control access to a resource from multiple processes. It is implemented using the unexported Base.Semaphore stored inside a Future which is only accessed on the process it was initialized on. Like Base.Semaphore , it implements acquire and release , and is not thread-safe.
