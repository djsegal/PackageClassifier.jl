Convex.jl Convex.jl is a Julia package for Disciplined Convex Programming . Convex.jl can solve linear programs, mixed-integer linear programs, and DCP-compliant convex programs using a variety of solvers, including Mosek , Gurobi , ECOS , SCS , and GLPK , through MathOptInterface . It also supports optimization with complex variables and coefficients. Installation : julia> Pkg.add("Convex") Detailed documentation and examples for Convex.jl ( stable | development version ). If you're running into bugs or have feature requests , please use the Github Issue Tracker . For usage questions, please contact us via Discourse . Quick Example Note: the following example uses the syntax of the master branch of Convex.jl. See the stable docs for examples for the current release. To run this example, first install Convex and at least one solver, such as SCS: using Pkg Pkg . add ( " Convex " ) Pkg . add ( " SCS " ) Now let's solve a least-squares problem with inequality constraints. # Let us first make the Convex.jl module available using Convex, SCS # Generate random problem data m = 4 ; n = 5 A = randn (m, n); b = randn (m, 1 ) # Create a (column vector) variable of size n x 1. x = Variable (n) # The problem is to minimize ||Ax - b||^2 subject to x >= 0 # This can be done by: minimize(objective, constraints) problem = minimize ( sumsquares (A * x - b), [x >= 0 ]) # Solve the problem by calling solve! solve! (problem, SCS . Optimizer) # Check the status of the problem problem . status # :Optimal, :Infeasible, :Unbounded etc. # Get the optimal value problem . optval More Examples A number of examples can be found here . The basic usage notebook gives a simple tutorial on problems that can be solved using Convex.jl. All examples can be downloaded as a zip file from here .
