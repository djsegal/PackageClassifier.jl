StratiGraphics.jl A tool for creating 3D stratigraphy from 2D geostatistical processes. This package provides an implementation of Markov-Poisson sampling as described in Hoffimann 2018 . In this method, geostatistical algorithms from the GeoStats.jl framework are used to quickly generate surfaces of a 3D stratigraphic model. Installation Get the latest stable release with Julia's package manager: ] add StratiGraphics Usage To illustrate the usage of the package, consider a set of satellite images containing spatial patterns that we would like to reproduce in a 3D stratigraphic model: Each image can serve as a training image for a multiple-point geostatistical process such as ImageQuilting.jl : using ImageQuilting solver1 = ImgQuilt ( :land => (TI = TI1, tilesize = ( 30 , 30 , 1 ))) solver2 = ImgQuilt ( :land => (TI = TI2, tilesize = ( 30 , 30 , 1 ))) solver3 = ImgQuilt ( :land => (TI = TI3, tilesize = ( 30 , 30 , 1 ))) procs = [ GeoStatsProcess (solver) for solver in [solver1,solver2,solver3]] We define a geological environment as a set of geological processes, a set of transition probabilities between the processes, and an event duration process: using StratiGraphics # transition probabilities P = rand ( 3 , 3 ) P = P ./ sum (P, dims = 2 ) # event duration process ΔT = ExponentialDuration ( 1.0 ) env = Environment (procs, P, ΔT) We can simulate the envinroment from an initial state (e.g. flat land) and for a number of epochs to produce a geological record: nepochs = 10 init = LandState ( zeros ( 100 , 100 )) record = simulate (env, init, nepochs) From the record, we can produce the strata in the form of surfaces: strata = Strata (record) We can choose between an :erosional (default) versus a :depositional stacking: strata = Strata (record, :depositional ) We can then convert the surfaces into a 3D voxel model by specifying the vertical resolution: voxelize (strata, 50 ) # produce a 100x100x50 voxel model For a reproducible example, please check this notebook .
