PlotThemes Primary author: Patrick Kofod Mogensen (@pkofod) PlotThemes is a package to spice up the plots made with Plots.jl . To install: Pkg . add ( " PlotThemes " ) Using PlotThemes Currently the following themes are available: :default :dark :ggplot2 :juno :lime :orange :sand :solarized :solarized_light :wong :wong2 :gruvbox_dark :gruvbox_light When using Plots, a theme can be set using the theme function: using Plots theme (thm :: Symbol ; kwargs ... ) theme accepts any Plots attribute as keyword argument and sets its value as default for subsequent plots. Themes can be previewed using Plots.showtheme(thm::Symbol) : :default :dark :ggplot2 :juno :lime :orange :sand :solarized :solarized_light :wong :wong2 :gruvbox_dark :gruvbox_light :bright :vibrant :mute Contributing A theme specifies default values for different Plots attributes . At the moment these are typically colors, palettes and colorgradients, but any Plots attribute can be controlled by a theme in general. PRs for new themes very welcome! Adding a new theme (e.g. mytheme ) is as easy as adding a new file (mytheme.jl) that contains at least the following line: _themes[ :mytheme ] = PlotTheme (; kwargs ... ) The keyword arguments can be any collection of Plots attributes plus a colorgradient keyword argument.
