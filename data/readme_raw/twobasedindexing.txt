TwoBasedIndexing This package implements two-based indexing in Julia. Two-based indexing affects only your code. Functions from other packages/modules will still function properly, but when you index into the arrays they return, the indices will start at 2 instead of 1. This makes it easy to gradually transition your codebase from obsolete one-based indexing to proper two-based indexing.
