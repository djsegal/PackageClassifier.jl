CrimsonDagger CrimsonDagger is a scheduler plugin to the Dagger.jl framework, which is based on the default Dagger scheduler "Sch". This plugin is both a staging ground for changes which are yet to be upstreamed to Dagger.Sch, as well as a place where fancier features may thrive that aren't suitable for upstreaming. Acknowledgements CrimsonDagger wouldn't exist without the contributions made to Dagger.Sch, and to Dagger.jl as a whole. Additionally, to quote from Dagger's README: We thank DARPA, Intel, and the NIH for supporting this work at MIT.
