ApproximateBayesianComputing (ABC) This package implements basic algorithms fo Approximate Bayesian Computing (ABC) in Julia. Currently, it implements a single algorithm, ABC-PMC based on Beaumont et al. 2002 via abc_pmc_plan_type. To Do Write more realistic examples, before finalizing interface Develope test cases Generalize to work with an abstract abc_plan_type Parallelize code Expand documentation Try to move GaussianMixtureModelCommonCovar to Distributions package Look into moving cov_weighted, ess (effective sample size) and calc_dist_ks to more general pacakges Implement additional ABC algorithms
