GenericSVD.jl Implements Singular Value Decomposition for generic number types, such as BigFloat , Complex{BigFloat} or Quaternion s . It internally overloads several Base functions such that existing methods ( svd , svdfact and svdvals ) should work directly. It uses a Golub-Kahan 2-stage algorithm of bidiagonalization with Householder reflections, followed by an implicit QR with shift. Acknowledgements Based on initial code by Andreas Noack.
