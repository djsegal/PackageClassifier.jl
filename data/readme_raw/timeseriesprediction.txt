Documentation Travis AppVeyor Gitter Repository for predicting timeseries using methods from nonlinear dynamics and timeseries analysis. It uses DelayEmbeddings . Kuramoto-Sivashinsky example This example performs a temporal prediction of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model. It is a one-dimensional system with the spatial dimension shown on the x-axis and its temporal evolution along the y-axis. The algorithm makes iterative predictions into the future that stay similar to the true evolution for a while but eventually diverge.
