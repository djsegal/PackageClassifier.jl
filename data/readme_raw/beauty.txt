Beauty.jl Beauty.jl provides Beauty for the output of your julia programs. NEVER include it in a package (as a fixed dependency): Beauty.jl achieves what it does through type piracy. That is not a good idea in general but the only way to alter output for types defined in other packages. DO include it as a user if you want to e.g. limit output of decimals. Also, do read the documentation . Beauty.jl: Beauty for julia programs is Copyright (C) 2019 Quantum Factory GmbH and published under the GPL3 .
