YaoExtensions Extensions for Yao . List of features Easy constructions circuits variational_circuit(n): construct a random parametrized circuit. rand_supremacy2d(nx, ny, depth): construct a quantum supremacy circuit. qft_circuit(n): construct a quantum fourier transformation circuit. rand_google53(): construct a Google's 53 qubit supremacy circuit. circuit building blocks general_U4(): an optimal decomposition of a U(4) gate. cphase(nbit, i, j), cz(nbit, i, j) hamiltonians heisenberg(n): construct a heisenberg hamiltonian. transverse_ising(n): construct a transverse field Ising hamiltonian. Block extensions primitive blocks SqrtX, SqrtY, FSim, ISWAP, SqrtW Mod: modulo operation block. QFT: faster implementation of QFT subroutine, instead of running QFT circuit faithfully, simulate it with classical fft (thus much faster). RotBasis: basis rotor, make measurements on different basis easier. MathGate: classical mathematic functions. ReflectGate: used in grover search, composite blocks Bag: a trivial container block that gives the flexibility to change the sub-block, as well as masking. Mainly used for structure learning. ConditionBlock: conditional control the excusion of two block. Sequence: similar to chain block, but more general, one can put anything inside. PauliString: a paulistring. Utlities gatecount, count the number of gates, faithful simulation of gradients, including observable loss and MMD loss
