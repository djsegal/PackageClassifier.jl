AlphaStableDistributions This library is a port of functionality from arlpy . The two distributions supported are alpha-stable distribution ( rand and fit ) alpha sub-Gaussian distribution with memory ( rand and fit ) Installation using Pkg; pkg " add https://github.com/org-arl/AlphaStableDistributions.jl " Usage julia > using AlphaStableDistributions julia > d1 = AlphaStable () AlphaStable {Float64} (α = 1.5 , β = 0.0 , scale = 1.0 , location = 0.0 ) julia > s = rand (d1, 100000 ); julia > d2 = fit (AlphaStable, s) AlphaStable {Float64} (α = 1.4748701622930906 , β = 0.0 , scale = 1.006340087707924 , location = - 0.0036724481641865715 ) julia > x = rand ( AlphaSubGaussian (n = 9600 )); julia > plot (x) Credits Julia code by @ymtoo and @baggepinnen , original implementation by @mchitre and others.
