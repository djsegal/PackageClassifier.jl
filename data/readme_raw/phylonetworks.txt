PhyloNetworks: analysis for phylogenetic networks Overview PhyloNetworks is a Julia package with utilities to: read / write phylogenetic trees and networks, in (extended) Newick format. Networks are considered explicit: nodes represent ancestral species. They can be rooted or unrooted. manipulate networks: re-root, prune taxa, remove hybrid edges, extract the major tree from a network, extract displayed networks / trees compare networks / trees with dissimilarity measures (Robinson-Foulds distance on trees) summarize samples of bootstrap networks (or trees) with edge and node support estimate species networks from multilocus data (see below) phylogenetic comparative methods for continuous trait evolution on species networks / trees plot networks (and trees), via the companion package PhyloPlots To get help, check the latest documentation the wiki for a step-by-step tutorial (July 2018) with background on networks the google group for common questions. Join the group to post/email your questions, or to receive information on new versions, bugs fixed, etc. If you use the package, please cite Claudia Solís-Lemus, Paul Bastide and Cécile Ané (2017).

The procedure involves a numerical optimization of branch lengths and inheritance probabilities and a heuristic search in the space of phylogenetic networks.
