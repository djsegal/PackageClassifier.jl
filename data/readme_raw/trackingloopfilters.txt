TrackingLoopFilters This implements multiple loop filters for GNSS tracking algorithms. Features First, second and third order loop filters Boxcar and bilinear loop filters Getting started Install: julia > ] pkg > add TrackingLoopFilters Usage using TrackingLoopFilters carrier_loop_filter = ThirdOrderBilinearLF () output, next_carrier_loop_filter = filter_loop (carrier_loop_filter, discriminator_output, Î”t, bandwidth)
