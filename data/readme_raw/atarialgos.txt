AtariAlgos Author: Thomas Breloff AtariAlgos wraps the ArcadeLearningEnvironment as an implementation of an AbstractEnvironment from the Reinforce interface . This allows it to be used as a plug-and-play module with general reinforcement learning agents. Setup: Pkg . clone ( " https://github.com/JuliaML/AtariAlgos.jl " ) (Optional) Download roms: using AtariAlgos AtariAlgos . download_roms () Games can also be "plotted" using Plots.jl through a simple definition of a recipe for AtariEnv objects, allowing it to be a component of more complex visualizations for tracking learning progress and more, as well as making it easy to create animations. Example using AtariAlgos # construct a game of Breakout game = AtariEnv ( " breakout " ) # set up for plotting using Plots gr (size = ( 200 , 300 ), leg = false ) rewards = Float64[] # run the episode using the Episode iterator, creating an animated gif in the process @gif for sars in Episode (game, RandomPolicy ()) push! (rewards, sars[ 3 ]) plot ( plot (game), sticks (rewards, yticks = nothing ), layout = @layout [a;b{ 0.2 h}] ) end every 10
