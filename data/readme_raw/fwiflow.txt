FwiFlow: Wave and Flow Inversion with Intelligent Automatic Differentiation Quick Install Documentation using Pkg; Pkg.add("FwiFlow") Highlights GPU-accelerated FWI module with checkpointing schemes; AMG-accelerated implicit pressure-implicit saturation scheme; Time Fractional Partial Differential Equations Philosophy We treat physical simulations as a chain of multiple differentiable operators, such as discrete Laplacian evaluation, a Poisson solver and a single implicit time stepping for nonlinear PDEs. They are like building blocks that can be assembled to make simulation tools for new physical models. Those operators are differentiable and integrated in a computational graph so that the gradients can be computed automatically and efficiently via analyzing the dependency in the graph. Independent operators are parallelized executed. With the gradients we can perform gradient-based PDE-constrained optimization for inverse problems. FwiFlow is built on ADCME , a powerful static graph based automatic differentiation library for scientific computing (with TensorFlow backend). FwiFlow implements the idea of Intelligent Automatic Differentiation .
