GitCommand GitCommand allows you to use command-line Git in your Julia packages. You do not need to have Git installed on your computer, and neither do the users of your packages! GitCommand provides a Git binary via Git_jll . Git_jll uses the Pkg Artifacts system, and therefore Git_jll and GitCommand require at least Julia 1.3. GitCommand is intended to work on any platform that supports Julia, including (but not limited to) Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD. Examples julia > using GitCommand julia > git () do git run ( ` $git clone https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General ` ) end Git REPL mode julia > using GitCommand julia > gitrepl () # you only need to run this once per Julia session # Press , to enter the Git REPL mode git > clone https : // github . com / JuliaRegistries / General Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health grants U54GM115677, R01LM011963, and R25MH116440.
