EponymTuples Julia package for deconstructing dispatch on NamedTuple s. Uses the variable names both for the NamedTuple and deconstruction. Allows replacing f ((a, b) :: NamedTuple{(:a, :b), <: Tuple{Any, Int}} ) = ... (a = a, b = b, c = 3 ) with f ( @eponymargs (a, b :: Int )) = ... @eponymtuple (a, b, c = 3 ) It is pretty lightweight: @eponymargs and @eponymtuple are the only symbols exported; and the package has no dependencies. The package is registered, install with pkg > add EponymTuples
