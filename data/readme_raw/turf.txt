Turf.jl Documentation Build Status A spatial analysis library written in Julia, ported from the great Turf.js . Turf.jl uses GeoInterface.jl and GeoJSON.jl to create and handle all geographic data. Installation Turf.jl can be installed either from the REPL using Pkg mode: pkg> add Turf or via Pkg : julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add("Turf") Alternatively if you want to use the latest version available, you can do: pkg> add Turf#master Example As an example, let's try to identify which points are within a certain polygon on the map and mark them with a different color. We can do this using Turf. # Turf already exports all symbols of GeoInterface.jl and GeoJSON.jl, so there's no need to import them using Turf # Let's create a basic geojson with a polygon and some points fc = """ { "type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [ { "type": "Feature", "properties": {}, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [5.185547, 47.753949], [-0.703125, 39.637989], [7.910156, 30.974436], [12.568359, 48.107339], [5.185547, 47.753949] ] ] } }, { "type": "Feature", "properties": {}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [12.304688, 43.3882]} }, { "type": "Feature", "properties": {}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [8.964844, 42.031854]} }, { "type": "Feature", "properties": {}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [2.548828, 41.901134]} }, { "type": "Feature", "properties": {}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [9.84375, 36.525174]} }, { "type": "Feature", "properties": {}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.878906, 38.546418]} }, { "type": "Feature", "properties": {}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [3.47168, 46.407564]} } ] } """ # convert the geojson into a FeatureCollection object geo_data = GeoJSON . parse (fc) # extract the polygon polygon = geo_data . features[ 1 ] . geometry # loop to see which points are inside the polygon # and add a 'marker-color' property to them for i in 2 : length (geo_data . features) feature = geo_data . features[i] point = feature . geometry if within (point, polygon) feature . properties = Dict ( " marker-color " => " #ff0000 " ) end end # convert the FeatureCollection back to geojson result = geojson (geo_data) If we then plot the results here's what we get: before: after: For more examples, please take a look at the Examples section of the documentation.
