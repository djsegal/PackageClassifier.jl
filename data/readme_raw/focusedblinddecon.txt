Focused Blind Deconvolution (FBD) FocusedBlindDecon is a Julia package that implements the following methods. lsbd! Least-squares blind deconvolution. fibd! Focused interferometric blind deconvolution. fpr! Focused phase retrieval. fbd! = fibd! + fpr! Focused blind deconvolution. These methods are described in the article below; if you make use of this code, please cite it. @article{bharadwaj2019focused, title={Focused blind deconvolution}, author={Bharadwaj, Pawan and Demanet, Laurent and Fournier, Aim{ \' e}}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing}, volume={67}, number={12}, pages={3168--3180}, year={2019}, publisher={IEEE} } Installation At the moment, FocusedBlindDecon depends on two unregistered packages Misfits and Conv .
