PolynomialAmoebas.jl Documentation Build Status A package to compute Amoebas in 2 and 3 variables. Installation Just do julia > using Pkg; julia > pkg " add PolynomialAmoebas " ; in a running Julia session. Getting started To construct polynomials we export the macro @polyvar from the DynamicPolynomials.jl package. using PolynomialAmoebas # Create variables @polyvar x y # construct a polynomial f = x ^ 2 * y + y ^ 2 + 3 x ^ 2 * y ^ 3 + y ^ 4 + x ^ 4 * y ^ 4 To compute the amoeba of f we then can simply do A = amoeba (f) To visualize the amoeba we use the plotting capabilities provided by Plots.jl . Just do using Plots plot (A) There is also a Jupyter notebook available to get an overview over the capabilties of the package. In order to set everything up for this follow the instructions in the IJulia.jl repository.
