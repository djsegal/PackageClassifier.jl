ChartParsers This package contains a simple implementation of a chart parser for context-free grammars, with both bottom-up and top-down prediction rules available. The algorithms implemented here are based on the excellent descriptions by Blackburn and Striegnitz, available online at http://cs.union.edu/~striegnk/courses/nlp-with-prolog/html/index.html This package was developed to support CrypticCrosswords.jl .
