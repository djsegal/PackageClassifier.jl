SimpleTropical This is an implementation of tropical (min-plus) arithmetic in Julia. Numbers The tropical numbers consist of the real numbers and infinity. The SimpleTropical module defines the Tropical type (which is a subtype of Number ). Tropical numbers can be parameterized by type, but this is taken care of automatically: julia > using SimpleTropical julia > x = Tropical ( 3.5 ) Tropical {Float64} ( 3.5 ) julia > y = Tropical {Int} ( 4 ) Tropical {Int64} ( 4 ) Tropical infinity is available via TropicalInf : julia> TropicalInf Tropical(âˆž) Arithmetic The + operation is defined as the min of the two values and * as the sum: julia > x + y Tropical {Float64} ( 3.5 ) julia > x * y Tropical {Float64} ( 7.5 ) The identity element for + is TropicalInf and the identity element for * is Tropical(0) : julia > x + TropicalInf Tropical {Float64} ( 3.5 ) julia > x * Tropical ( 0 ) Tropical {Float64} ( 3.5 ) No elements in tropical arithmetic have additive inverses, but they do have multiplicative inverses (except for infinity): julia > inv (x) Tropical {Float64} ( - 3.5 ) julia > inv (TropicalInf) ERROR : AssertionError : TropicalInf is not invertible Exponentiation by integers works: julia > x ^ 10 Tropical {Float64} ( 35.0 ) julia > x ^- 2 Tropical {Float64} ( - 7.0 ) Predicates Use isinf(X) to test if a tropical number is infinity. julia > isinf (x) false julia > isinf (TropicalInf) true The usual comparison operators == and !== work as expected: julia > Tropical ( 3.0 ) == Tropical ( 3 ) true julia > Tropical ( 3.1 ) != Tropical ( 3 // 1 ) true To do list Make the Polynomials module work with tropical numbers.
