MUMPSseq - An interface to sequential MUMPS This is a Julia interface to the sequential version of the MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver MUMPS . A MUMPS package for Julia using the MPI interface is already registered. Travis tests are currently failing, perhaps because the version of libdmumps_seq on Travis's Ubuntu 12.04 systems, is out-of-date? Will need to create a more fully-featured deps/build.jl .
