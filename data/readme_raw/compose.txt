Compose! Compose is a vector graphics library for Julia. It forms the basis for the statistical graphics system Gadfly . Synopsis Unlike most vector graphics libraries, Compose is thoroughly declarative. Rather than issue a sequence of drawing commands, graphics are formed by sticking various things together and then letting the library figure out how to draw it. The "things" in this case fall one of three types: Property, Form, and Canvas. "Sticking together" is primary achieved with the compose function. The semantics of composition are fairly simple, and once grasped provide a consistent and powerful means of building vector graphics.
