SimpleValueGraphs.jl This is a experimental package that uses the interface from LightGraphs.jl . It is similar to MetaGraphs.jl and SimpleWeightedGraphs.jl . It solves the following problem: The topology of MetaGraphs can be changed fast, but changing and querying edge values is slow. Changing the topology of SimpleWeightedGraphs is slow, but changing and querying edge values is fast.
