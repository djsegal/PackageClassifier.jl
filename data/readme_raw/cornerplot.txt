CornerPlot CornerPlot.jl is a plotting package in julia built on top of Gadfly.jl. Inspired by [corner.py ]( https://github.com/dfm/corner.py ), it plots samples in multiple dimensions as a triangular matrix of subplots showing the samples in pairs of dimensions. To use make such a plot, simply call corner with an array of shape (nsamples, ndims) or a DataFrame containing your samples: corner(df) Further optional arguments can be seen in the example IJulia notebook or in the docstrings of the code.
