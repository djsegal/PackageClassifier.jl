LNR LNR.jl implements a LineNumberingReader type which transparently wraps any other reader ( ::IO ). It's intended for working with hand written text where line and column information is significant, and provides functions for working with this information. LineNumberingReader s can be created with either an IO object or a string as a parameter. The Cursor type, which has the line and column fields, represents a position between two characters (and not the character itself). So Cursor(n, m) represents the position just before the m th character on line n . Comparisons are supported. The cursor function gives the current position in the stream as a cursor. seek can be called as usual, but with a Cursor instead of an integer, to set the reader at any position in the file. Other than that, standard IO functions are wrapped, so you can use a line reader as you would any other stream.
