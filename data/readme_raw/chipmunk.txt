Chipmunk.jl Chipmunk.jl is a Julia binding of the popular physics engine [Chipmunk] ( https://chipmunk-physics.net/ ) ([Github page] ( https://github.com/slembcke/Chipmunk2D )). This is currently very much in progress. Take a look at the examples/ folder to see what you can do with Chipmunk.jl Chipmunk.jl uses [SFML.jl] ( https://github.com/zyedidia/SFML.jl ) to render the world to the screen. Chipmunk.jl also requires Julia 0.4. Installation Installation is quite simple. The package will clone and install chipmunk from source to deps/ . Make sure that you have cmake installed so that it can build chipmunk. I have not been able to get cmake to compile Chipmunk on Windows yet. If you get an SFML build error about follow_symlinks you should update your version of Julia 0.4. julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/zyedidia/Chipmunk.jl") julia> Pkg.build("Chipmunk") [License] (LICENSE.md)
