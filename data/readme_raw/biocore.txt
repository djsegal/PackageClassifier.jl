BioCore.jl Description BioCore.jl provides core definitions that are common to all or many packages in the BioJulia ecosystem. It also includes a definition of a common IO interface for IO of Bioinformatics formats in BioJulia packages, and includes some helper functions for generating file parsers from state machine automata with Automa.jl Installation BioCore is a dependency for other BioJulia packages, but you can install it yourself with: using Pkg add ( " BioCore " ) # Pkg.add("BioCore") for julia prior to v0.7 If you are interested in the cutting edge of the development, please check out the master branch to try new features before release. Testing BioCore.jl is tested against Julia 0.7 and 1.0.x on Linux, OS X, and Windows.
