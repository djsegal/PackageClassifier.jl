NoveltyColors Linux/OSX: This package is intended to be a lightweight package for non-standard color palettes. Unlike Color.jl , there is not (necessarily) any theoretical underpinnings to these palettes. Color palettes provided within this package may represent Internet memes, generalized color palettes seen in advertising or on television/movies, or just aesthetically pleasing colors. If you are visualizing data for presentation or publication, you should validate that any of these color schemes provide acceptable contrast when printed in Black & White, are appropriate for colorblind individuals and any other considerations. The color palettes are stored and exported in a plain Julia Dict type, named ColorDict Contributions Contributions are absolutely welcome; however, please be sure that any color palette/package code is licensed under the terms of the MIT "Expat" license or more permissive. To submit a contribution, submit a pull request where the data file has the same structure as WesAnderson.json : the file name represents what the color palette will be called, with the values in the text file as JSON where each key is a AbstractString and its value will be an AbstractArray of hex codes.
