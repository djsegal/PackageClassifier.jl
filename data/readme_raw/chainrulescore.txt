ChainRulesCore Docs: The ChainRulesCore package provides a light-weight dependency for defining sensitivities for functions in your packages, without you needing to depend on ChainRules itself. This will allow your package to be used with ChainRules.jl , which aims to provide a variety of common utilities that can be used by downstream automatic differentiation (AD) tools to define and execute forward-, reverse-, and mixed-mode primitives. This package is a work in progress; PRs welcome!
