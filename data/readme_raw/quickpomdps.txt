QuickPOMDPs Simplified interfaces for specifying POMDPs.jl models. The package contains two interfaces - the Quick interface, and the Discrete Explicit interface. Please see the documentation for more information on each. The package can also be used from Python via pyjulia . See examples/tiger.py for an example. Quick Interface The Quick Interface exposes nearly all of the features of POMDPs.jl as constructor keyword arguments. Documentation , Mountain Car Example: mountaincar = QuickMDP ( function (s, a, rng) x, v = s vp = clamp (v + a * 0.001 + cos ( 3 * x) *- 0.0025 , - 0.07 , 0.07 ) xp = x + vp if xp > 0.5 r = 100.0 else r = - 1.0 end return (sp = (xp, vp), r = r) end , actions = [ - 1. , 0. , 1. ], initialstate = ( - 0.5 , 0.0 ), discount = 0.95 , isterminal = s -> s[ 1 ] > 0.5 ) Discrete Explicit Interface The Discrete Explicit Interface is suitable for problems with small discrete state, action, and observation spaces. This interface is pedagogically useful because each element of the (S, A, O, R, T, Z, γ) tuple for a POMDP and (S, A, R, T, γ) tuple for an MDP is defined explicitly in a straightforward manner. Documentation , Tiger POMDP Example: S = [ :left , :right ] A = [ :left , :right , :listen ] O = [ :left , :right ] γ = 0.95 function T (s, a, sp) if a == :listen return s == sp else # a door is opened return 0.5 # reset end end function Z (a, sp, o) if a == :listen if o == sp return 0.85 else return 0.15 end else return 0.5 end end function R (s, a) if a == :listen return - 1.0 elseif s == a # the tiger was found return - 100.0 else # the tiger was escaped return 10.0 end end m = DiscreteExplicitPOMDP (S,A,O,T,Z,R,γ)
