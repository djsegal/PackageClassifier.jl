CPLEX.jl CPLEX.jl is an interface to the IBM® ILOG® CPLEX® Optimization Studio . It provides an interface to the low-level C API, as well as an implementation of the solver-independent MathProgBase and MathOptInterface API's. You cannot use CPLEX.jl without having purchased and installed a copy of CPLEX Optimization Studio from IBM . However, CPLEX is available for free to academics and students . This package is available free of charge and in no way replaces or alters any functionality of IBM's CPLEX Optimization Studio product. Note: This wrapper is maintained by the JuliaOpt community and is not officially supported by IBM. However, we thank IBM for providing us with a CPLEX license to test CPLEX.jl on Travis. If you are a commercial customer interested in official support for CPLEX in Julia, let them know!. Installation First, you must obtain a copy of the CPLEX software and a license. Then, set the appropriate environment vairable and run Pkg.add("CPLEX") . # Linux ENV[ " CPLEX_STUDIO_BINARIES " ] = " /path/to/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux " # OSX ENV[ " CPLEX_STUDIO_BINARIES " ] = " /path/to/cplex/bin/x86-64_osx " # Windows ENV[ " CPLEX_STUDIO_BINARIES " ] = " C:/IBM/CPLEX_Studio128/cplex/bin/x64_win64 " import Pkg Pkg . add ( " CPLEX " ) Help! I got LoadError: Unable to locate CPLEX installation Which version of CPLEX are you trying to install? Currently, CPLEX.jl only supports 1280 and 1290 given recent changes to the API . If you want to support newer versions of CPLEX not listed above, file an issue with the version number you'd like to support. Some steps need to be taken (like checking for new or renamed parameters) before CPLEX.jl can support new versions. Use with JuMP You can use CPLEX with JuMP via the CPLEX.Optimizer() solver. Set solver parameters using set_parameter from JuMP : model = Model ( with_optimizer (CPLEX . Optimizer)) set_parameter (model, " CPX_PARAM_EPINT " , 1e-8 ) Parameters match those of the C API in the CPLEX documentation .
