Graft.jl Build Pkg Status Coverage License Documentation A graph toolkit for Julia. Graft stores vertex and edge metadata in separate dataframes. Adjacencies are stored in a sparsematrix, which also indexes into the edge dataframe. Vertex labels are supported for all external queries, using a bidirectional map. Vertex labels may be of any Julia type. Data manipulation and analysis in Graft is accomplished with a pipelined query macro system adopted from Jplyr. User queries are parsed recursively, to build a DAG. The DAG is then executed from the bottom up. Results from the execution of intermediate nodes or table data-retrievals are cached to avoid redundant computations.
