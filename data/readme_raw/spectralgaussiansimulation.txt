SpectralGaussianSimulation.jl This package provides an implementation of spectral Gaussian simulation as described in Gutjahr 1997 . In this method, the covariance function is perturbed in the frequency domain after a fast Fourier transform. White noise is added to the phase of the spectrum, and a realization is produced by an inverse Fourier transform. The method is limited to simulations on regular grids, and care must be taken to make sure that the correlation length is small enough compared to the grid size. As a general rule of thumb, avoid correlation lengths greater than 1/3 of the grid. The method is extremely fast, and can be used to generate large 3D realizations.
