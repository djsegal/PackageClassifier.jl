AnimatedPlots Animated plots is a package for making animated and static plots. It is built on top of [SFML.jl] ( https://github.com/zyedidia/SFML.jl ) and allows for fast plotting of functions and variables over time. Installation Make sure you have SFML and CSFML installed (see the SFML [installation instructions] ( https://github.com/zyedidia/SFML.jl#installation ) for more information) julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/zyedidia/AnimatedPlots.jl") Usage The easiest way to plot a function is to use the plot function: Static Plots julia> plot(sin) julia> close(current_window()) A StaticGraph object can also be passed to plot if you want to be able to modify the graph afterward (such as changing the color or line thickness) julia> sin_graph = StaticGraph(sin, thickness=5, color=SFML.blue) # thickness and color julia> plot(sin_graph) julia> sin_graph.color = SFML.green julia> plot(cos) julia> close(current_window()) Animated Plots You can use the AnimatedGraph to make animated plots. julia> animated_sin = AnimatedGraph(sin) julia> plot(animated_sin) julia> animated_cos = AnimatedGraph(cos, color=SFML.blue, startx=-10) julia> animated_cos.speed = 3 # Speed in units per second julia> plot(animated_cos) julia> follow(animated_cos) # have the camera follow the plot See examples/double_pendulum.jl for an advanced showcase of how to integrate an animated plot into an SFML application Output AnimatedPlots supports creating images and gifs of your plots. Creating gifs may take a while, only close your program after it says Created gif file.gif . In addition, you must have [imagemagick] ( http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php ) installed in order to make gifs (most package managers provide it). julia> screenshot("my_screenshot.png") # Take a screenshot and save it to my_screenshot.png julia> make_gif(300, 300, 10, "MyGif.gif", 0.06) # Create a gif with width, height, duration (in seconds), filename, and delay (the delay between each frame in seconds)
