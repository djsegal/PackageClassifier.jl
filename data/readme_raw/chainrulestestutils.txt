ChainRulesTestUtils.jl Utilities for testing forward- and reverse-mode AD sensitivities. ChainRulesTestUtils.jl is designed to help you test ChainRulesCore.frule and ChainRulesCore.rrule methods. Currently this is done via testing the rules against numerical differentiation (using FiniteDifferences.jl ). ChainRulesTestUtils.jl is separate from ChainRulesCore.jl so that it can be a test-only dependency, allowing it to have potentially heavy dependencies, while keeping ChainRulesCore.jl as light-weight as possible.
