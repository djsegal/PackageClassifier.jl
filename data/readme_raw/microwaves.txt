Microwaves This package is ultimately intended to provide a library of functions useful for RF and microwave engineering. Currently, the main feature being implemented is a touchstone file reader and plotting recipes for the read data. There is currently a semi-functional reader named read_touchstone() , however this does not work for all touchstone files, and it will be superseded soon by interfacing with FileIO so users can simply call load() . Additionally, functionality for network manipulation and basic network synthesis is planned. Any other useful ideas/features people can come up with are more than welcome as well. If it is not apparent, this package is in the early stages of its development and its API should not be considered stable.
