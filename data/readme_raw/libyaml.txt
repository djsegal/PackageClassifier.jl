LibYAML A Julia library wrapping the (LibYAML)[ https://github.com/yaml/libyaml ] C library. [unfortunately, Windows is not yet supported] Note: This package is abandoned It turns out that wrapping LibYAML directly in Julia is not feasible since LibYAML uses unions in its types. It is unclear to me how to create respective Julia types that have the correct size. It might be necessary to create C wrappers that allocate or free LibYAML's objects, and provide Julia accessors that don't use C unions.
