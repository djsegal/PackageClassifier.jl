MemberFunctions.jl MemberFunctions.jl helps writing member-like functions, reducing the amount of code required to implement them. All functions prefixed by the @member macro can access, i.e. read and write, fields of the first argument directly. Example mutable struct Foo value end @member get_value (foo :: Foo ) = value @member function set_value! (foo :: Foo , v) value = v end foo = Foo ( 1 ) set_value! (foo, 2 ) get_value (foo) == 1 set_value! (foo, 2 ) get_value (foo) == 2
