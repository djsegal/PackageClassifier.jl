LatinHypercubeSampling.jl Documentation Build & Testing Status LatinHypercubeSampling is a Julia package for the creation of optimised Latin Hypercube Sampling Plans. The genetic optimisation algorithm is largely based on the work by Bates et al. [1]. The package includes additional functionality for the creation of an optimised subset of an existing plan. For more details, see our paper . Features: Creation of an optimised Latin Hypercube Sampling plan. Generate an optimised subset of an existing plan. Refine existing plan. Ability to include discrete parameters in the design. Installation The package is registered and can be installed with Pkg.add . julia > Pkg . add ( " LatinHypercubeSampling " ) Documentation STABLE â€” tagged version of the documentation.
