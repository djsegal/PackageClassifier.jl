MessagePack RPC Server for Julia A Julia implementation of MessagePack-RPC Server Library. Usage Write some code using MsgPackRpcServer: import MsgPackRpcServer module RemoteFunctions function add(x, y) x+y end end @async MsgPackRpcServer.run(8080, RemoteFunctions) and run ruby -r msgpack-rpc -e "p MessagePack::RPC::Client.new('127.0.0.1', 8080).call(:add, 2, 3)" then you will get 5 calculated by Julia. Limitations As of v0.0.1, only very basic synchronous rpc call on TCP Socket is implemented. Following features are to be supported in the future. Asynchronous Call Multiple Transports such as UDP, UNIX domain socket High Performance Capability such as single-threaded model or event-driven architecture etc. License MIT Reference MessagePack-RPC Specification MessagePack specification
