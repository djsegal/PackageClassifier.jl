Depreciated: this functionalithy has been rolled into Flatten.jl, with ulflatten , ulreconstruct and ulupdate! functions available if you load using Unitful . UnitlessFlatten UnitlessFlatten.jl extends Flatten.jl to provide struct flattening that strips units. This can be far more efficient than simply stripping them afterwards as it improves type stability. Simply use as you would use Flatten.jl, and types will be flattened to Unitless tuples or vectors, and reconstructed including the original units.
