EarthOrientation.jl Calculate Earth orientation parameters from IERS tables in Julia. Installation The package can be installed through Julia's package manager: pkg > add EarthOrientation Quickstart Fetch the latest IERS tables: using EarthOrientation EarthOrientation . update () Get the current Earth orientation parameters, e.g. for polar motion: xp, yp = polarmotion ( now ()) # arcseconds Or the current difference between UT1 and UTC and the associated prediction error: ΔUT1 = getΔ UT1 ( now ()) # seconds ΔUT1_err = getΔ UT1_err ( now ()) # seconds Documentation Please refer to the documentation for additional information.
