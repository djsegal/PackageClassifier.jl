CMake This package is designed to make it easier for Julia packages to build binary dependencies that use CMake. It automatically downloads a modern version of CMake (3.X.Y, instead of the Ubuntu 14.04 default of 2.8.12), and it exports a constant cmake giving the path of this executable. For a BinDeps.jl -compatible CMakeProcess class for automatically building CMake dependencies, see the CMakeWrapper.jl package. Installation julia> Pkg.add("CMake") Usage using CMake gives you access to a constant string cmake giving the path of the cmake executable.
