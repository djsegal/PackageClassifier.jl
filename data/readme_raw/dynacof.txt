DynACof: The Dynamic Agroforestry Coffee Crop Model Overview This is a Julia version of the DynACof model. To get to the R version, please follow this link . DynACof is a process-based model that computes plot-scale Net Primary Productivity, carbon allocation, growth, yield, energy, and water balance of coffee plantations according to management, while accounting for spatial effects using metamodels from the 3D process-based MAESPA . The model also uses coffee bud and fruit cohorts for reproductive development to better represent fruit carbon demand distribution along the year. Installation To download DynACof, simply execute these lines of code in the REPL: Pkg . add (DynACof) The package is tested routinely to pass all tests using Travis-CI (Linux + Mac) and AppVeyor (Windows). Example This is a basic example using the parameters and meteorology from Vezy et al. (2019). First, you have to dowload the data from this Github repository . Then, simply execute this line of code to run a simulation over the whole period: using DynACof Sim, Meteo, Parameters = dynacof (input_path = " the_path_where_you_downloaded_the_data/DynACof.jl_inputs " , file_name = (constants = " constants.jl " ,site = " site.jl " ,meteo = " meteorology.txt " , soil = " soil.jl " ,coffee = " coffee.jl " ,tree = " tree.jl " )); To use your own data, you have to tell DynACof where to find it using the input_path argument, and what are the file names with the file_name argument. A separate Github repository is available for input files templates, and some help on how to proceed. Example of a simulation without shade trees: Sim, Meteo, Parameters = dynacof (input_path = " the_path_where_you_downloaded_the_data/DynACof.jl_inputs " , file_name = (constants = " constants.jl " ,site = " site.jl " ,meteo = " meteorology.txt " , soil = " soil.jl " ,coffee = " coffee.jl " ,tree = " " )); Notes The model first computes the shade tree, then the coffee and then the soil. So if you need to update the metamodels, please keep in mind that the state of soil of a given day is only accessible on the next day for the tree and the coffee, unless the code is updated too. The model is implemented like this for simplicity, based on the hypothesis that the soil has a rather slow dynamic compared to plants dynamics.
