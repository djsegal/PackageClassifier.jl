DASKR A solver for differential algebraic equations (DAE). This wraps the original DASKR FORTRAN solver. DASKR is a derivative of the DASSL solver with root finding. An interface to the JuliaDiffEq common interface is also provided. Common Interface Example using DASKR u0 = [ 1.0 , 0 , 0 ] du0 = [ - 0.04 , 0.04 , 0.0 ] tspan = ( 0.0 , 100000.0 ) function resrob (r,yp,y,p,tres) r[ 1 ] = - 0.04 * y[ 1 ] + 1.0e4 * y[ 2 ] * y[ 3 ] r[ 2 ] = - r[ 1 ] - 3.0e7 * y[ 2 ] * y[ 2 ] - yp[ 2 ] r[ 1 ] -= yp[ 1 ] r[ 3 ] = y[ 1 ] + y[ 2 ] + y[ 3 ] - 1.0 end prob = DAEProblem (resrob,u0,du0,tspan) sol = solve (prob, daskr ()) The options for solve are documented at the common solver options page .
