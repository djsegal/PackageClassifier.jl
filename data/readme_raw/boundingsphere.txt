BoundingSphere Package contains algorithms to calculate smallest enclosing sphere for a given set of points in N dimensions. BoundingSphere.jl is a complete rewrite from scratch of Miniball.jl . See Miniball.jl issue #28 . Usage using BoundingSphere pts = [ randn ( 3 ) for _ in 1 : 10 ] center, radius = boundingsphere (pts) using StaticArrays pts = [ @SVector ( randn ( 3 )) for _ in 1 : 10 ] # use static arrays for performance algorithm = Ritter () # fast but inaccurate center, radius = boundingsphere (pts, algorithm) # customize algorithm
