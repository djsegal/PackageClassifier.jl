QDLDL.jl - A free LDL factorisation routine QDLDL is a factorisation routine for quasi-definite linear systems Ax=b . This is a pure Julia implementation of the C language QDLDL solver ( https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/qdldl ) with some additional functionality implemented to support refactorisations. Getting Started QDLDL requirers Julia v1.0 and can be added via the Julia package manager (type ] ): pkg> add QDLDL . Make the package available in you project with using QDLDL . Using QDLDL QDLDL can be used to solve linear systems Ax = b . Given a quasidefinite matrix A and right-hand side vector b , compute the factorisation F with: F = qdldl (A) Solve the linear system for x with: x = solve (F, b) This will allocate new memory for x . To solve in-place and overwrite b with x use: solve! (F, b) Authors Paul Goulart License This project is licensed under the Apache License - see the LICENSE.md file for details.
