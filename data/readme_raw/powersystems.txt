PowerSystems The PowerSystems.jl package provides a rigorous data model using Julia structures to enable power systems analysis and modeling. In addition to stand-alone system analysis tools and data model building, the PowerSystems.jl package is used as the foundational data container for the PowerSimulations.jl package. PowerSystems.jl supports a limited number of data file formats for parsing. Version Advisory The latest tagged version in PowerSystems will work with Julia v1.2+. Device data enabled in PowerSystems: Generators (Thermal, Renewable and Hydro) Transmission (Lines, and Transformers) Active Flow control devices (DC Lines and phase-shifters) Topological elements (Buses, Arcs, Areas) Storage (Batteries) Load (Static, and curtailable) Services (Reserves, transfers) Forecasts (Deterministic, scenario, stochastic) Dynamic Components Parsing capabilities in PowerSystems: MATPOWER CaseFormat PSS/E - PTI Format RTS-GMLC table data format Installation You can install it by typing julia > ] add PowerSystems Usage Once installed, the PowerSystems package can by used by typing using PowerSystems Development Contributions to the development and enahancement of PowerSystems is welcome.
