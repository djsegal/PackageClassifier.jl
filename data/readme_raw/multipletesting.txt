MultipleTesting The MultipleTesting package offers common algorithms for p-value adjustment and combination as well as the estimation of the proportion π₀ of true null hypotheses. Features Adjustment of p-values Bonferroni Benjamini-Hochberg Adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg with known π₀ or π₀ estimation method (see section below) Benjamini-Yekutieli Benjamini-Liu Hochberg Holm Hommel Sidak Forward Stop Barber-Candès adjust (pvals, Bonferroni ()) adjust (pvals, BenjaminiHochberg ()) adjust (pvals, BenjaminiHochbergAdaptive ( 0.9 )) adjust (pvals, BenjaminiHochbergAdaptive ( Storey ())) adjust (pvals, BenjaminiYekutieli ()) adjust (pvals, BenjaminiLiu ()) adjust (pvals, Hochberg ()) adjust (pvals, Holm ()) adjust (pvals, Hommel ()) adjust (pvals, Sidak ()) adjust (pvals, ForwardStop ()) adjust (pvals, BarberCandes ()) The adjustment can also be performed on the k smallest out of n p-values: adjust (pvals, n, PValueAdjustmentMethod) Estimation of π₀ Storey Storey's closed-form bootstrap Least Slope Two Step RightBoundary (Storey's estimate with dynamically chosen λ) Beta-Uniform Mixture (BUM) Censored BUM Flat Grenander Oracle for known π₀ estimate_pi0 (pvals, Storey ()) estimate_pi0 (pvals, StoreyBootstrap ()) estimate_pi0 (pvals, LeastSlope ()) estimate_pi0 (pvals, TwoStep ()) estimate_pi0 (pvals, TwoStep ( 0.05 )) estimate_pi0 (pvals, TwoStep ( 0.05 , BenjaminiHochbergAdaptive ( 0.9 )) estimate_pi0 (pvals, RightBoundary ()) estimate_pi0 (pvals, CensoredBUM ()) estimate_pi0 (pvals, BUM ()) estimate_pi0 (pvals, FlatGrenander ()) estimate_pi0 (pvals, Oracle ( 0.9 )) Combination of p-values Fisher Stouffer, optionally with weights Logit Tippett Simes Wilkinson Minimum of adjusted p-values combine (pvals, FisherCombination ()) combine (pvals, StoufferCombination ()) combine (pvals, weights, StoufferCombination ()) combine (pvals, LogitCombination ()) combine (pvals, TippettCombination ()) combine (pvals, SimesCombination ()) combine (pvals, WilkinsonCombination (rank)) combine (pvals, MinimumCombination ( PValueAdjustment ())) Higher criticism Higher criticism scores Higher criticism threshold estimate (pvals, HigherCriticismScores ()) estimate (pvals, HigherCriticismThreshold ()) Installation The MultipleTesting package is part of the Julia ecosphere and the latest release version can be installed with Pkg . add ( " MultipleTesting " ) More details on packages and how to manage them can be found in the package section of the Julia documentation.
