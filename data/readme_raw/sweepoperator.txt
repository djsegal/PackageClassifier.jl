SweepOperator Build Test The symmetric sweep operator is a powerful tool in computational statistics with uses in stepwise regression, conditional multivariate normal distributions, MANOVA, and more. This package exports a single function: sweep! sweep! (A, k ; inv = false ) sweep! (A, ks; inv = false ) Perform the sweep operation (or inverse sweep if inv=true ) on symmetric matrix A on element k (or each element in ks ). Only the upper triangle is read/swept. Example: x = randn ( 100 , 10 ) xtx = x ' x sweep! (xtx, 1 ) sweep! (xtx, 1 , true ) Details on Symmetric Sweeping: Thank you to great notes provided by @Hua-Zhou
