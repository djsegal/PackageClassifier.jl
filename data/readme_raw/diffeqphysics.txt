DiffEqPhysics Simulation of gravitationally interacting bodies In order to create bodies/particles for the problem, one needs to use the MassBody structure and its constructor, which accepts mass, initial coordinates and velocity of the body. body1 = MassBody ( 2.0 , SVector ( 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ), SVector ( 5.775e-6 , 0.0 , 0.0 )) body2 = MassBody ( 2.0 , SVector ( 0.0 , - 1.0 , 0.0 ), SVector ( - 5.775e-6 , 0.0 , 0.0 )) Usually we solve an n-body problem for a certain period of time: tspan = ( 0.0 , 1111150.0 ); Solving gravitational problem one needs to specify the gravitational constant G. G = 6.673e-11 In fact, now we have enough parameters to create an NBodyGravProblem object: problem = NBodyGravProblem ([body1,body2], G, tspan) Solution to the problem might be evaluated using the standard solve function: solution = solve (problem, Tsit5 ()); And, finally, we plot our solution showing two equal bodies rotating on the same orbit: plot_xy_scattering (solution, " ./anim_two_boddies_scattering.gif " )
