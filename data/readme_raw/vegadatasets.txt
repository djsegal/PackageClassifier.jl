VegaDatasets Overview This package provides an easy way to load the datasets in vega-datasets from julia. Installation You can install this package from the julia REPL with the following command: Pkg . add ( " VegaDatasets " ) Getting started The package only exports one function that takes the name of a dataset and returns a VegaDataset with that data: using VegaDatasets vg = dataset ( " iris " ) VegaDataset implements the iterable tables interface, so it can be passed to any sink that accepts iterable tables. For example, to convert a dataset into a DataFrame , you can write: using VegaDatasets, DataFrames df = DataFrame ( dataset ( " iris " )) You can pipe a VegaDataset directly into a VegaLite.jl plot: using VegaLite, VegaDatasets dataset ( " iris " ) |> @vlplot ( :point , x = :sepalLength , y = :petalWidth ) Non-tabular datasets The following datasets are not tabular in nature: earthquakes graticule londonBoroughs londonTubeLines miserables us_10m world_110m In those cases an object is returned that can be lowered to JSON, or one can access the .path property for such an object to get a path to the location of the dataset.
