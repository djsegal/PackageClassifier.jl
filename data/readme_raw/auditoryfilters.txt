This package provides auditory filter implementations in Julia. The following implementations are available: A gammatone filterbank based on Malcolm Slaney's Auditory Toolbox ; a gammatone-like spectrogram implementation, based on Dan Ellis' implementation ; a modulation filterbank based on the paper titled "Characterizing frequency selectivity for envelope fluctuations" (2000), by Ewert and Dau.
