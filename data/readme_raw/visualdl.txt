VisualDL.jl This package provides a julia wrapper for VisualDL , which is a deep learning visualization tool that can help design deep learning jobs. Currently, the wrapper is written on top of the Python SDK of VisualDL by PyCall . I have tried to write the wrapper on top of the C++ SDK by leveraging CxxWrap.jl . But unluckily a strange error encountered. Hopefully I'll figured it out later and swap the backend into C++. Install First, install the Python client of VisualDL. Checkout here for a detailed guide. Then add this package as a dependent(only tested on Julia v0.7). (v0.7) pkg> add VisualDL Usage First, initial the logger. using VisualDL train_logger = VisualDLLogger ( " tmp " , 1 , " train " ) test_logger = as_mode (train_logger, " test " ) Scalar for i in 1 : 100 with_logger (train_logger) do @log_scalar s0 = (i, rand ()) s1 = (i, rand ()) end with_logger (test_logger) do @log_scalar s0 = (i, rand ()) s1 = (i, rand ()) end end Histogram for i in 1 : 100 with_logger (train_logger) do @log_histogram h0 = (i, randn ( 100 )) end end Text for i in 1 : 100 with_logger (train_logger) do @log_text t0 = (i, " This is test " * string (i)) end end Image for i in 1 : 100 with_logger (train_logger) do @log_image i0 = ([ 3 , 3 , 3 ], rand ( 27 ) * 255 ) end end for i in 1 : 100 with_logger (test_logger) do @log_image image0 = rand ( 10 , 10 , 3 ) * 255 end end # force save and sync save (train_logger) save (test_logger) Finally, run visualDL --logdir ./tmp in current dir. Then launch the visualdl service and watch the above pictures in browser.
