Gridap Documentation Build Status Community Gridap provides a set of tools for the grid-based approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs) written in the Julia programming language . The main motivation behind the development of this library is to provide an easy-to-use framework for the development of complex PDE solvers in a dynamically typed style without sacrificing the performance of statically typed languages. The library currently supports linear and nonlinear PDE systems for scalar and vector fields, single and multi-field problems, conforming and nonconforming finite element discretizations, on structured and unstructured meshes of simplices and hexahedra. Documentation STABLE — Documentation for the most recently tagged version of Gridap.jl. DEVEL — Documentation for the in-development version of Gridap. ARTICLE — F. Verdugo, S. Badia.
