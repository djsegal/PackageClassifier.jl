PerformanceTestTools Testing generated IRs inside CI is useful for avoiding performance regression. However, test suites are normally run under flags like --check-bounds=yes and --code-coverage=user which block julia compiler to generate efficient code. PerformanceTestTools.@include(script) automatically detects such flags and run the script in a separate julia process started without these flags.
