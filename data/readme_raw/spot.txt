Spot This package provides Julia bindings to the Spot library for LTL and automata manipulation. It relies on Cxx.jl to interface julia with the Spot c++ library. If you wish to use PyCall instead and interact with the spot python bindings you should checkout the branch pycall (linux only). Installation For the rendering, Spot requires GraphViz and dot2tex to be installed. In addition, the precompile binaries require gcc 7 or 8 (not needed for Mac). using Pkg; Pkg . add ( " Spot.jl " ) Windows support: The registered version of Cxx.jl is currently broken for Windows. However, the branch gn-patch-crash is working for now. The build script should checkout the right branch. Otherwise run ] add Cxx#gn-patch-crash in the julia environment where you wish to install Spot. Usage LTL Manipulation Construct LTL formula using a non standard string literal: f = ltl " FG a -> FG b " The formula will be automatically parsed by Spot. LTL to Automata Translation using Spot ltl = " FG A " translator = LTLTranslator (deterministic = true ) a = translate (translator, ltl) Tutorial A basic tutorial is available in docs/spot_basic_tutorial.ipynb Notes Right now, the wrapping of all the c++ functions present in libspot is not automatic. Every function can be called using the Cxx interface. If you need to wrap a function that has not been wrapped yet, feel free to submit a Pull Request.
