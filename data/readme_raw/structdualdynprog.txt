StructDualDynProg Documentation PackageEvaluator Build Status Social Generic interface for the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) algorithm as well as a generic implementation. The problem can either be provided using the StructJuMP modeling interface or using a lower level interface. This package is used by the Entropic Cone package. Documentation STABLE — most recently tagged version of the documentation. LATEST — in-development version of the documentation. Installation The master branch is aimed at JuMP v0.19. To try this package with JuMP v0.19, do: ] add StructJuMP # master ] add StructDualDynProg # master Note that this package has not been updated yet to JuMP v0.19, see here . Notes for choice of solvers This package should work with any linear programming (LP) solver supported by MathProgBase . If some subproblems are infeasible, an infeasibility ray will be asked to the solver. In this case, it is advised to turn presolve off in CPLEX (i.e. CPLEX.CplexSolver(CPX_PARAM_REDUCE=0) ) and to avoid using Clp since it often cannot find the infeasibility ray . If some subproblems are unbounded, an unbounded ray and a feasible solution will be asked for the solver. Again, avoid using Clp in that case . Hopefully subproblems shouldn't be unbounded if detectlb is left at true when calling SOI.stochasticprogram .
