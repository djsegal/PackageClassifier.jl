JuliaGIS A package for the visualization and manipulation of geographic data. Concept JuliaGIS provides a frontend for interacting with geographic data in Julia. The backend is provided by GDAL.jl for raster data, the as-yet unwritten OGR.jl wrapper for vector data, and Images for visualization. Installation Pkg.clone("git://github.com/wkearn/GIS.jl") Usage using GIS allows you to use all of the GIS contained within GDAL, the fictional OGR and any other core GIS packages. Thus using GIS allows you to open_raster("/path/to/raster/file") . display(raster) converts the raster to a RasterImage type and displays the RasterImage using ImageView Todo Multiple raster display -- this probably requires some messing with GDAL.jl (and maybe OGR to deal with projections) Multi-band raster support -- once this is added to GDAL.jl, a couple of quick tweaks to RasterImage properties will let you display multi-band rasters as RGB images.
