HilbertSpaceFillingCurve Bindings for Doug Moore's Fast Hilbert Curve Generation . Windows is not supported. Usage Convert the linear index d into ndims-dimensional coordinates p : p = hilbert(d::T, ndims, nbits = 32) where T <: Integer Convert the ndims-dimensional coordinates p into the linear index d : d = hilbert(p::Vector{T}, ndims, nbits = 32) where T <: Integer All coordinates are positive integers (zero included). The number of bits nbits determines the precision of the curve, and the algorithm work under the constrain: ndims * nbits <= 64 License License from the original code: /* LICENSE * * This software is copyrighted by Rice University.
