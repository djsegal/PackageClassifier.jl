ExactDiagonalization.jl Julia package for the exact diagonalization method in condensed matter physics. Introduction Based on the symbolic operator representation of a quantum lattice system in condensed matter physics that is generated by the package QuantumLattices , exact diagonalization method is implemented for fermionic, hard-core-bosonic and spin systems. Documentation LATEST — documentation of the latest version. STABLE — documentation of the stable version. Note Due to the fast development of this package, releases with different minor version numbers are not guaranteed to be compatible with previous ones before the release of v1.0.0. Comments are welcomed in the issues. Contact waltergu1989@gmail.com
