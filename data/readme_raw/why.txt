Why.jl Provides a single function why() which returns a randomly generated String giving an explanation. Example outputs: "Because some harmless and properly type-safe cockatoo and the fast type pirate decided so." "Some deceitful and vaguely self aware person and the programmer wanted it." "Some not at all self aware and very self aware compiler and some deceitful research software engineer decided so." "The rudimentary struct and a self aware research software engineer and a vaguely scary config file could not prevent it." A follow up function how() is a current work in progress. (Initially a project from the JuliaCon 2018 hackathon)
