IntervalLapper This is a Julia port of my Rust port of nim-lapper . Install ] add IntervalLapper Docs See the docs for the rust-lapper project. The API's are essentially the same. The version 5.0.0 release is virtually identical at the time of writing this readme. https://docs.rs/rust-lapper/ Examples using Test import IntervalLapper const IL = IntervalLapper const Iv = IL . Interval{Int} data = map (x -> Iv (x, x + 15 , 0 ), 0 : 10 : 100 ) lapper = IL . Lapper (data) cursor = Ref ( 1 ) e1 = Iv ( 0 , 15 , 0 ) e2 = Iv ( 10 , 25 , 0 ) @test [e1, e2] == collect (IL . find (lapper, 8 , 20 )) @test [e1, e2] == collect (IL . seek (lapper, 8 , 20 , cursor)) @test 2 == length ( collect (IL . find (lapper, 8 , 20 ))) bits = IL . Bits (lapper . intervals) @test IL . count (bits, 8 , 20 ) == length ( collect (IL . find (lapper, 8 , 20 ))) Benchmarks TBD. Anecdotally seems speedy, but no optimizations have been done. I'm sure there some funkiness with type instability or missed broadcasting opportunities.
