KissMCMC Got a probability density function you want to draw samples from? Don't want to learn all the fancy stuff of the fancy sampler packages? The KissMCMC (Keep it simple, stupid, MCMC) package intends to provide a few simple MCMC samplers. using KissMCMC # the distribution to sample from, logpdf (x :: T ) where {T} = x < 0 ? - convert (T, Inf ) : - x # initial point of walker theta0 = 0.5 # Metropolis MCMC sampler: sample_prop_normal (theta) = 1.5 * randn () + theta # samples the proposal (or jump) distribution thetas, accept_ratio = metropolis (logpdf, sample_prop_normal, theta0, niter = 10 ^ 5 ) println ( " Accept ratio Metropolis: $accept_ratio " ) # emcee MCMC sampler: thetase, accept_ratioe = emcee (logpdf, make_theta0s (theta0, 0.1 , logpdf, 100 ), niter = 10 ^ 5 ) # check convergence using integrated autocorrelation thetase, accept_ratioe = squash_walkers (thetase, accept_ratioe) # puts all walkers into one println ( " Accept ratio emcee: $accept_ratio " ) using Plots histogram (thetas, normalize = true , fillalpha = 0.4 ) histogram! (thetase, normalize = true , fillalpha = 0.1 ) plot! ( 0 : 0.01 : 5 , map (x -> exp ( logpdf (x)[ 1 ]), 0 : 0.01 : 5 ), lw = 3 ) outputs: MCMC samplers: Metropolis (serial) metropolis Affine invariant MCMC, aka emcee emcee (threaded) References Other, probably better Julia MCMC packages: https://github.com/tpapp/DynamicHMC.jl https://github.com/madsjulia/AffineInvariantMCMC.jl https://github.com/brian-j-smith/Mamba.jl and many others The (original) emcee python package: http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/
