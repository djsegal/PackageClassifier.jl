MechanismGeometries This package implements several methods of generating or loading geometries associated with a RigidBodyDynamics.jl Mechanism in Julia. It is currently used by MeshCatMechanisms.jl but can also be used independently. Interface This package exports one primary method: visual_elements (mechanism :: Mechanism , source :: AbstractGeometrySource ) visual_elements returns a vector of VisualElement structs, each of which contains: frame : A CartesianFrame3D indicating where the geometry is attached in the mechanism geometry : One of the GeometryTypes.jl types color : an RGBA color from ColorTypes.jl transform : a Transformation from CoordinateTransformations.jl indicating the pose of the geometry w.r.t its attached frame. Currently implemented sources These demonstrations use the Boston Dynamics Atlas robot from AtlasRobot.jl . using AtlasRobot using MechanismGeometries mechanism = AtlasRobot . mechanism () Skeleton Skeleton <: AbstractGeometrySource The Skeleton type uses only the joints and bodies in the mechanism itself to construct a visual representation of the robot's links. The sticks connect joints in the mechanism and the ellipsoids represent the mass and moment of inertia of each body: visual_elements (mechanism, Skeleton ()) The moment of inertia ellipsoids can also be turned off, leaving just the joint connections: visual_elements (mechanism, Skeleton (inertias = false )) URDF Visuals URDFVisuals <: AbstractGeometrySource The URDFVisuals type loads the visual elements from a given URDF file (passed as either a filename or a parsed XMLDocument from LightXML.jl). One particularly useful argument is package_path , which accepts a list of strings to use as potential directories to search when encountering mesh files using the ROS package:// syntax. visual_elements (mechanism, URDFVisuals (AtlasRobot . urdfpath (), package_path = [AtlasRobot . packagepath ()])) URDF Extensions The following extensions to the URDF spec are parsed by MechanismGeometries.jl: <plane normal="0 0 1"/> : Represents an infinite plane perpendicular to the normal given as an x y z unit vector. Returns a MechanismGeometries.HyperPlane
