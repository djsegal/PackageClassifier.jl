LaTeXTools LaTeXTools.jl is a collection of tools for transforming TeX/LaTeX documents programmatically in order to reduce syntax errors arising from manual transformations. I developed this package because I found it useful in the writing/automated testing of my dissertation, and I continue to find it useful (and will add features etc.) in preparation of new manuscripts written in the style I prefer. If you find it useful, great! Contributions/comments/questions welcome. v0.3.1 How do I get set up? Install Julia v0.4+ Clone this repository into a convenient place (add, if you would like to your PATH environment variable) and make sure you have the packages listed in the REQUIRE file Who do I talk to?
