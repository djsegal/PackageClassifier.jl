This package provides support for Stata '.dta' files from Stata verison 8 and above. Quickstart using Pkg Pkg . add ( " DTALib.jl " ) using DTALib data = DTALib . read ( " <your_stata_dataset>.dta " ) The read function returns a DTA structure which includes two fields: 1. the Header, and 2. the Data. Continuing with the previous example. The Header can be separately accessed from the 'data' variable by the dot syntax, i.e. data . Header Similarly the Data can be accessed by data . Data Features Currently supports: Reading .dta files. Specifically it supports dta versions: 113: Stata 8 114: Stata 10 115: Stata 12 117: Stata 13 118: Stata 14, 15, and 16 119: Stata 15 and 16 (when dataset has more than 32,767 variables) Reading Header information including: the Dataset Label the Dataset Timestamp Missing values There are plans to support: Writing to .dta files Very long strings, specifically, strings longer than 2,045 bytes, aka strL's in Stata's terms Variable labels: i.e. no labelling for binary (0,1) or categorical encoded variables (0, 1, 2, ...)
