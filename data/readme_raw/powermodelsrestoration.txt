PowerModelsRestoration.jl Dev: A PowerModelsRestoration provides extensions to PowerModels for solving the power system restoration tasks. A core building block in PowerModelsRestoration is the Maximum Load Delivery (MLD) problem, which provides a reliable numerical method for solving challenging N-k damage scenarios, such as those that arise in the analysis of extreme events. Core Problem Specifications Restoration Ordering Problem (rop) Minimum Restoration Set Problem (mrsp) Forward Restoration Redispatch Maximum Load Delivery with Discrete Variables (mld_uc) Maximum Load Delivery with Continuous Variables (mld) Core Network Formulations AC (polar coordinates) DC Approximation (polar coordinates) SOC Relaxation (W-space) SDP Relaxation (W-space) Citing PowerModelsRestoration If you find the MLD problem from PowerModelsRestoration useful in your work, we kindly request that you cite the following publication : @article{8494809, author={Carleton Coffrin and Russel Bent and Byron Tasseff and Kaarthik Sundar and Scott Backhaus}, title={Relaxations of AC Maximal Load Delivery for Severe Contingency Analysis}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Power Systems}, volume={34}, number={2}, pages={1450-1458}, month={March}, year={2019}, doi={10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2876507}, ISSN={0885-8950} } Citation of the PowerModels framework is also encouraged when publishing works that use PowerModels extension packages.
