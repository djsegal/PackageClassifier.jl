LifeTable The LifeTable module contains the function periodlifetable , which can be used to calculate life tables in accordance with the methods used by Human Mortality Database (in particular, see the Methods Protocol 38--39). The function is called like periodlifetable(inframe, sex, openend, intype) , where inframe is a DataFrame , sex may be given as 1 or 2 for males or females (the calculation of average numbers lived for those dying as infants differs between the sexes), and intype can be "count" (the default) or "rate" . The first column in inframe is assumed to contain the start of the included age intervals. If openend=true (default), the last row is assumed to include data for an open interval at the end of life; if openend=false it is assumed to include a closed interval of the same size as the second last row. If intype="count" , the second column is assumed to be a vector of age-specific population at risk, and the third column is assumed to be a vector of age-specific death counts. If intype="rate" , the second column is assumed to contain age-specific death rates. The function returns a new DataFrame with the life table. Column Description age Start of age interval. m Age-specific death rates. a Expected numbers of years lived at a given age for someone dying at that age. q Age-specific death probabilities. p Age-specific survival probabilities. l Probability of survival to a given age. d Distribution of deaths by age. ld Number of years lived at a given age. t Remaining number of years to live at a given age. e Life expectancy at a given age. The function causelife(lifetable, causefreq) takes a lifetable returned by periodlifetable and a vector of the same length as the number of rows in the life table, with the proportion of deaths at a given age caused by a specific disease (or another cause). It returns a DataFrame with the following columns: Column Description age Start of age interval (same as the input life table). m Age-specific death rates normalized to the frequency of the cause of death (the next column). f The proportion of the population surviving to a given age that will die of the specific cause. The DataFrame returned by causelife can be used as input to periodlifetable (with intype="rate" ) to compute a new lifetable for the subpopulation dying of a specific cause. The function mortsurvfit(lifetable, numbdeaths, func, functype) fits the m column (if functype="rate" ) or the l column (if functype="surv" ) against the age column in a DataFrame returned by periodlifetable with a Gompertz function (if func="gompertz" ) or a two-parameter Weibull function (if func="weibull" ). See e.g. Juckett and Rosenberg (1993) for a discussion of these different functions and their applications to human mortality and survival data. The columns are fitted using LsqFit , and the data points are weighted by the square root of the age-specific number of deaths (given in numbdeaths ). All input columns are assumed to be DataArrays, and are converted to ordinary arrays in order to work with LsqFit. mortsurvfit returns a dictionary with the func and functype parameters and the LsqFitResult returned by the curve fitting. mortsurvparamsfit(msfits) takes a list of dictionaries returned by mortsurvfit and performs linear regression (using GLM ) on transformations of the coefficients in the list. This can be used to determine intersections between mortality or survival curves. A dictionary containing (1) a DataFrame with the original parameters and transformations and (2) the results from the regression is returned.
