NIfTI.jl Usage To read a NIfTI file: using NIfTI ni = niread ( " my.nii " ) ni = niread ( " my.nii.gz " ) # gzipped NIfTI files are detected automatically The header is in nii.header ; NIfTI extensions are in nii.extensions ; the raw volume is in nii.raw . To mmap the NIfTI file: ni = niread ( " my.nii " , mmap = true ) To get the TR and voxel size: vsize = voxel_size (ni . header) # In mm tr = time_step (ni . header) # In ms To get the value of the volume along a given dimension: d = vox (ni, x, y, z, t) # Scaled by slope and intercept given in header, zero-based indexes d = ni[x, y, z, t] # Scaled by slope and intercept given in header, one-based indexes d = ni . raw[x, y, z, t] # Unscaled, one-based indexes Colons works everywhere, even with vox To write a volume: niwrite ( " my.nii " , ni) It is also possible to construct a new volume from scratch; see the NIVolume constructor in the source for documentation.
