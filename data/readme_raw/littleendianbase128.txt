LittleEndianBase128.jl Little Endian Base 128 (LEB128) encoding and decoding module for the Julia programming language Introduction LEB128 or Little Endian Base 128 is a form of variable-length code compression used to store an arbitrarily large integer in a small number of bytes. There are 2 versions of LEB128: unsigned LEB128 and signed LEB128. The decoder must know whether the encoded value is unsigned LEB128 or signed LEB128.

This is the tradeoff of getting a large compression factor. Consequently when decoding, you'll need to reshape the output back to the original shape, because no shape information is retained within the encoded data. Also notice that the final decode command assumed that the output is unsigned, so it produced incorrect output. If you have encoded signed data that you wish to decode, then you need to call decodesigned or decode(::Array{UInt8,1}, ::DataType) with an appropriate signed data type passed in the second argument.
