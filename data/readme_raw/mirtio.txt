MIRTio.jl https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRTio.jl File I/O routines for MIRT (Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox) in Julia This code is isolated from the main MIRT.jl toolbox, because complete tests of these functions require large files that are not part of the repo. The primary functions exported are for reading GE MRI kspace data: loadpfile read_rdb_hdr Utility functions for reading and writing fixed-length structured headers, which are common in legacy medical imaging formats, are in src/ge-mri/header.jl , such as header_read and header_write . This software was developed at the University of Michigan by Jeff Fessler and his group . This code is a package dependency of MIRT.jl so most users will never clone this repo directly. Installing MIRT by following the instructions at https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRT.jl will automatically include this code through the magic of Julia's package manager. Tested with Julia 1.0.5, 1.3, 1.4, and should work with 1.1, 1.2.
