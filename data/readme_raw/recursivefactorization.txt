RecursiveFactorization RecursiveFactorization.jl is a package that collects various recursive matrix factorization algorithms. Implemented Algorithms: Sivan Toledo's recursive left-looking LU algorithm. DOI: 10.1137/S0895479896297744 Usage: RecursiveFactorization does not export any functions. julia > using RecursiveFactorization julia > A = rand ( 5 , 5 ); julia > RecursiveFactorization . lu (A); # out-of-place julia > RecursiveFactorization . lu! ( copy (A)); # in-place julia > RecursiveFactorization . lu! ( copy (A), Vector {Int} (undef, size (A, 2 ))); # in-place w/ pivoting vector Performance: For small to medium sized matrices, it is beneficial to use RecursiveFactorization over OpenBLAS . The benchmark script is available in perf/lu.jl
