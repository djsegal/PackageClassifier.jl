DictViews.jl Provides the immutable types KeysView{K,V} and ValuesView{K,V} for dynamic, low-overhead views into the entries (either the keys or the values) of a dictionary. The types implement the start , done , and next methods for iterating over the entries. They respectively inherit the View{K} and View{V} abstract type which implements the eltype , and length methods.
