MakieThemes WIP The idea of this package is to create a collection of themes for Makie to customize the size and look of plot elements and colors. It will initially focus on porting themes from existing plotting packages. Currently I've started work on a GGThemr library, that aims to emulate the themes at https://github.com/cttobin/ggthemr . Here's the current default look of Makie on my machine: using Makie scene = scatter ( randn ( 20 ), randn ( 20 ), markersize = 0.2 ) scatter! (scene, randn ( 20 ), randn ( 20 ), markersize = 0.2 ) scatter! (scene, randn ( 20 ), randn ( 20 ), markersize = 0.2 ) scatter! (scene, randn ( 20 ), randn ( 20 ), markersize = 0.2 ) scatter! (scene, randn ( 20 ), randn ( 20 ), markersize = 0.2 ) Using the :fresh theme from GGThemr using MakieThemes show_ggthemr ( :fresh ) Here's an expanded visualization based on the examples in the source theme: using CSV, Pkg, MakieThemes, AbstractPlotting, Makie, StatsMakie for dataset âˆˆ ( :www , :drivers , :mtcars , :diamonds ) @eval const $ (dataset) = CSV . read ( dirname ( pathof (MakieThemes)) * " /../data/ " * $ ( string (dataset)) * " .tsv " , delim = ' \t ' ) end AbstractPlotting . set_theme! ( ggthemr ( :fresh )) p1 = scatter ( Data (www), :Minute , :Users , Group (color = :Measure , marker = :Measure ), markersize = 6 , marker = [ :rect , :circle ]); p2 = plot (density, Data (mtcars), :mpg , Group (color = :cyl )); p3 = plot (Position . stack, histogram, Data (diamonds), :price , Group (color = :cut )); p4 = boxplot ( Data (drivers), :Year , :Deaths ); vbox ( hbox (p3, p1), hbox (p4, p2)) This is the target theme I'm aiming for (image created with R) Current issues: font sizes vary, and the font is too bold alignments across subpanels axis line thickness the period of the dashed line overplotting of the axes by the dashed line the missing legends outliers and median marker for the boxplots reversed colors for the histogram colored fill area labelling of x and y axes implicit position of the 0,0 point within axes no white edge around marker points Many of these should be addressed in StatsMakie or AbstractPlotting rather than here. Currently supported theme libraries are: ggthemr
