PosDefManifold.jl Documentation PosDefManifold is a Julia package for manipulating data in the manifold P of real or complex positive definite matrices . The package supports 10 metrics acting on P , two of which define Riemannian manifolds . This package computes distances , geodesics , weighted Fréchet means and inductive Fréchet means for the supported metrics, graph Laplacians , Lapacian eigen maps , tangent space projections , parallel transport , the geometric midrange , matrix approximations and a special solution of the Procrustes problem in P . Key functions are multi-threaded . The documentation is rich and gives all mathematical details pertaining to the implemented functions. For machine learning in P see PosDefManifoldML.jl . For optimization in P see Manopt.jl . See also Manifolds.jl . For similar code resources in other programming languages see here .
