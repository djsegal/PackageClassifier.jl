TransformUtils.jl Lie groups and algebra, quaternions, Angle Axis and Euler angles; products and compare also available. Introduction This package is a growing collection of Lie Group/Algebra, Quaternion, Euler, AxisAngle representations. Including convert functions between each, and overloading operators for those sets. The package already includes exponential, logarithm maps and Jacobians for Lie SO(3). SE(3) mostly complete. Interesting usage Supports mangle products, for example (using identity constructors): julia> pp = SO3(0) * Quaternion(0) * so3(0.1*randn(3)) * AngleAxis(0) Or maybe you want to compare against another rotation julia> compare(SO3(0), pp) # returns true or false Install Pkg.add("TransformUtils") To do's Mangled compare functions compare(Quaternion(0), SO3(0)) Rework SE(2) to type, and not functions
