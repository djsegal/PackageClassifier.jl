DynamicGridsGtk Provides a GTK interface for visualising simulations with DynamicGrids.jl and packages that build on it like Dispersal.jl . To create a Gtk window for use as a simulation output: using DynamicGridsGtk output = GtkOutput (init; fps = 25 , showfps = fps, store = false , processor = ColorProcessor ()) Where init is the initialisation array for the simulation, and processor can be any FrameProcessor from DynamicGrids.jl. Keyword arguments are optional, with defaults shown above. Documentation See the documentation for DynamicGrids.jl Note: using Gtk on Windows will lead to very slow performance of the REPL and IDEs like Atom. Use DynamicGridsInteract instead.
