VoronoiFVM.jl Solver for coupled nonlinear partial differential equations based on the Voronoi finite volume method. This Julia package merges the ideas behind pdelib /fvsys with the multiple dispatch paradigm of Julia. It allows to avoid the implementation of function derivatives. It instead uses ForwardDiff and DiffResults to evaluate user functions along with their jacobians. It requires Julia 1.x API changes: v0.7 (some are breaking)
