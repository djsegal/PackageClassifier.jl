The ARCHModels Package for Julia ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models are a class of models designed to capture a feature of financial returns data known as volatility clustering , i.e. , the fact that large (in absolute value) returns tend to cluster together, such as during periods of financial turmoil, which then alternate with relatively calmer periods. This package provides efficient routines for simulating, estimating, and testing a variety of GARCH models. Installation ARCHModels is a registered Julia package. To install it in Julia 1.0 or later, do add ARCHModels in the Pkg REPL mode (which is entered by pressing ] at the prompt). Documentation The extensive documentation is available here .
