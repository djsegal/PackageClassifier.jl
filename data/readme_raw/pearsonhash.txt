PearsonHash This package provides utility functions for Pearson hashing . You can use the standard 8-bit hash function: julia > hash8 ( " Test " ) 77 Or use hashn to get multiple of 8 bits (i.e. ( 8*n )-bit hash): julia > hashn ( " Test " , 2 ) 0x0000000000000000000000000000424d Note that hashn always returns a UInt128 integer, so you will need to convert this to a smaller data type if necessary.
