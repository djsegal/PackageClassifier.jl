ForestBiometrics.jl A package for various forest mensuration and biometrics functions in Julia ForestBiometrics.jl is a package for working with forest measurements data and growth and yield modeling. This package was inspired by its R counterpart, the lmfor package with the addition of equations from the western US. For more info on lmfor, please see http://cs.uef.fi/~lamehtat/rcodes.htm It is my hope that the package not only ports existing functionality from other languages, but also showcases the abilities of Julia as a programming language and how concepts like multiple dispatch and metaprogramming can be used to solve domain-specific problems. ** Currently in the process of updating since the 1.0.X release, so things may be in flux or broken ** Documentation Installation ] add ForestBiometrics If you are interested in this package and would like to contribute, feel free to submit an issue or pull request. Dependencies The following Julia packages are used in this package: PlotRecipes for plotting functionality OffsetArrays.jl for creating lookup tables for Scribner Decimal C scaling Example outputs Gingrich stocking guides SDI chart with lines at 100%, 55% and 35% max SDI Walkthroughs I am creating a series of short examples walking through topical problems and how this package can be used to solve those problems. They can be found in this repo under examples/walkthroughs or from the links below. Examples include: HeightDiameter Stand exam calculations
