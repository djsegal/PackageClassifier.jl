StatFiles Overview This package provides load support for Stata, SPSS, and SAS files under the FileIO.jl package. Installation Use Pkg.add("StatFiles") in Julia to install StatFiles and its dependencies. Usage Load a Stata, SPSS, or SAS file To read a Stata, SPSS, or SAS file into a DataFrame , use the following julia code: using StatFiles, DataFrames df = DataFrame ( load ( " data.dta " )) The call to load returns a struct that is an IterableTable.jl , so it can be passed to any function that can handle iterable tables, i.e. all the sinks in IterableTable.jl . Here are some examples of materializing a Stata, SPSS, or SAS file into data structures that are not a DataFrame : using StatFiles, DataTables, IndexedTables, TimeSeries, Temporal, Gadfly # Load into a DataTable dt = DataTable ( load ( " data.dta " )) # Load into an IndexedTable it = IndexedTable ( load ( " data.dta " )) # Load into a TimeArray ta = TimeArray ( load ( " data.dta " )) # Load into a TS ts = TS ( load ( " data.dta " )) # Plot directly with Gadfly plot ( load ( " data.dta " ), x = :a , y = :b , Geom . line) Using the pipe syntax load also support the pipe syntax. For example, to load a Stata, SPSS, or SAS file into a DataFrame , one can use the following code: using StatFiles, DataFrames df = load ( " data.dta " ) |> DataFrame The pipe syntax is especially useful when combining it with Query.jl queries, for example one can easily load a Stata, SPSS, or SAS file, pipe it into a query, then pipe it to the save function to store the results in a new file.
