UncertainData.jl A Julia package for dealing with data values with associated uncertainties and datasets consisting of uncertain values. Goals Systematic and intuitive ways of representing uncertain data. Easy and robust resampling of uncertain data, given pre-defined or custom user-defined constraints. Provide a framework for robust computation of ensemble statistics for uncertain data. Please check out the documentation for more information. Installation UncertainData.jl is a registered Julia package. Install it by opening a Julia console and run using Pkg Pkg . add ( " UncertainData " ) Citing If you use UncertainData.jl for any of your projects or scientific publications, please cite this small Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) publication as follows Haaga, (2019).
