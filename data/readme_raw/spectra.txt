Spectra.jl Copyright (c) 2016-2019 Dr. Charles Le Losq email: lelosq@ipgp.fr Spectra.jl is a package aimed at helping spectroscopic (Raman, Infrared, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, XAS...) data treatment under Julia. Spectra.jl aim is to provide a simplest way to perform actions like baseline fitting and removal, or peak fitting for instance, while respecting the freedom offered by data treatment through using a computer code instead of a Graphic User Interface. Documentation News See the NEWS.md Installation In Julia 1.0 and later, use the pkg environment (key ] ), then directly run add Spectra . Examples See the examples notebooks in the ./examples/ folder for usage examples. Licence see LICENCE.md Citation If you happen to use Spectra in your work, please cite as: LE LOSQ, Charles.
