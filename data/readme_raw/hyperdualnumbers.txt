JuliaDiff/HyperDualNumbers Documentation Build Status Hyper-dual numbers can be used to compute first and second derivatives numerically without the cancellation errors of finite-differencing schemes. The initial Julia implementation (up to v3.0.1) is directly based on the C++ implementation by Jeffrey Fike and Juan J Alonso, both of Stanford University, department of Aeronautics and Astronautics as described in the paper: The Development of Hyper-Dual Numbers for Exact Second Derivative Calculations Up to v3.0.1 the Julia versions have been derived/written by Rob J Goedman ( goedman@icloud.com ). HyperDualNumbers.jl v4.0.0 has been completely redone by Benoit Pasquier and follows the structure of the JuliaDiff/DualNumbers package. For a quick into, see STEPBYSTEP.md Latest tagged versions: v1.1.0 (Julia 0.5 & 0.6, Oct 2017) v2.0.0 (Julia v0.7-, Oct 2017) v3.0.1 (Julia v0.7 & Julia v1.0), Aug 2018, Pkg(3)) v4.0.0 (Julia v1.0, Nov 2018) For details see VERSION.md The following functions are specific to hyperdual numbers: Hyper , Hyper256 , Hyper128 , ishyper ,y2 hyper_show realpart , ε₁part() , replaces eps1, ε₂part() , replaces eps2, ε₁ε₂part() , replaces eps1eps2 In the future it is my intention to deprecate: hyper , hyper256 , hyper128 , eps1 , eps2 , eps1eps2 Documentation STABLE — documentation of the most recently tagged version. DEVEL — documentation of the in-development version. Questions and issues Question and contributions are very welcome, as are feature requests and suggestions.
