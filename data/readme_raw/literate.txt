Literate Documentation Build Status Literate is a package for Literate Programming . The main purpose is to facilitate writing Julia examples/tutorials that can be included in your package documentation. Literate can generate markdown pages (for e.g. Documenter.jl ), and Jupyter notebooks , from the same source file. There is also an option to "clean" the source from all metadata, and produce a pure Julia script. Using a single source file for multiple purposes reduces maintenance, and makes sure your different output formats are synced with each other. This README was generated directly from this source file running these commands from the package root of Literate.jl: using Literate Literate . markdown ( " examples/README.jl " , " . " ; documenter = false ) This page was generated using Literate.jl .
