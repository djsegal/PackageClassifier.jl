Vega.jl Linux: pkg.julialang.org: NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS IN A STATE OF LIMBO Vega.jl on METADATA works for version 0.6 in Jupyter Notebook. Work to convert to version 3 of Vega and adding support for Atom/Juno may happen in the future, but is not my highest priority. -- Randy, 1/10/2018 Introduction A Julia package for creating Vega visualizations. Convenience functions for common visualizations are provided, while also allowing for unlimited customization through modification of the main VegaVisualization composite type. At a high-level, Vega.jl is designed to provide an easy-to-use library to quickly make common visualizations, while also including some of the interactivity provided as part of the Vega 2.x JavaScript library. This package also provides a declarative syntax that deviates from Grammar-of-Graphics style packages. This package is unrelated to VegaLite.jl , other than to have the same underlying vega JavaScript engine. Perhaps that will change in the future as cross-package efficiencies become more obvious! Installation Pkg.add("Vega") using Vega Using Vega from the REPL/Atom will work with or without an Internet connection, as the required JavaScript libraries are injected into the HTML before the browser is opened (automatically). Documentation Please see the documentation , which is rendered on-the-fly using Vega code generated from Vega.jl TODO/Contributing GitHub issues has a To-Do list of visualizations and open bugs/feature requests; of course, any contribution is welcomed!
