Curvelet.jl - The 2D Curvlet Transform The curvelet transform is a fairly recent image processing technique that is able to easily approximate curves present in images. This package is an implementation of the “Uniform Discrete Curvelet Transform” as described in “Uniform Discrete Curvelet Transform” by Truong T. Nguyen and Hervé Chauris. Basic usage is as follows: require("src/Curvelet.jl") x = rand(128,128) X = Curvelet.curveletTransform(x) y = Curvelet.inverseCurveletTransform(X) Restrictions Currently this transform works only for a simple class of inputs: square images with dimensions that are powers of two in length and at least 16x16.
