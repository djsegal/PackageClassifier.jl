PredictMDExtra PredictMDExtra is a meta-package that installs all of the Julia dependencies of PredictMD (but not PredictMD itself). Installing PredictMDExtra does not install PredictMD. If you would like a convenient way of installing PredictMD and all of its Julia dependencies, see PredictMDFull . Table of Contents Installation Installation PredictMDExtra is registered in the Julia General registry. Therefore, to install PredictMDExtra, simply open Julia and run the following four lines: import Pkg Pkg . activate ( " PredictMDEnvironment " ; shared = true ) Pkg . add ( " PredictMDExtra " ) import PredictMDExtra That being said, PredictMDExtra is not very useful by itself. Instead, I recommend that you install PredictMDFull, which includes both PredictMD and PredictMDExtra. To install PredictMDFull, simply open Julia and run the following four lines: import Pkg Pkg . activate ( " PredictMDEnvironment " ; shared = true ) Pkg . add ( " PredictMDFull " ) import PredictMDFull
