RobustPmap Robust paralleization using pmap calls with checks for the type of returned values. RobustPmap is a module of MADS . MADS MADS (Model Analysis & Decision Support) is an integrated open-source high-performance computational (HPC) framework in Julia . MADS can execute a wide range of data- and model-based analyses: Sensitivity Analysis Parameter Estimation Model Inversion and Calibration Uncertainty Quantification Model Selection and Model Averaging Model Reduction and Surrogate Modeling Machine Learning and Blind Source Separation Decision Analysis and Support MADS has been tested to perform HPC simulations on a wide-range multi-processor clusters and parallel environments (Moab, Slurm, etc.). MADS utilizes adaptive rules and techniques which allows the analyses to be performed with a minimum user input. The code provides a series of alternative algorithms to execute each type of data- and model-based analyses. Documentation All the available MADS modules and functions are described at madsjulia.github.io Installation Pkg . add ( " Mads " ) Installation behind a firewall Julia uses git for the package management. To install Julia packages behind a firewall, add the following lines in the .gitconfig file in your home directory: [url "https://"] insteadOf = git:// or execute: git config --global url. " https:// " .insteadOf git:// Set proxies: export ftp_proxy=http://proxyout. < your_site > :8080 export rsync_proxy=http://proxyout. < your_site > :8080 export http_proxy=http://proxyout. < your_site > :8080 export https_proxy=http://proxyout. < your_site > :8080 export no_proxy=. < your_site > For example, if you are doing this at LANL, you will need to execute the following lines in your bash command-line environment: export ftp_proxy=http://proxyout.lanl.gov:8080 export rsync_proxy=http://proxyout.lanl.gov:8080 export http_proxy=http://proxyout.lanl.gov:8080 export https_proxy=http://proxyout.lanl.gov:8080 export no_proxy=.lanl.gov MADS examples In Julia REPL, do the following commands: import Mads To explore getting-started instructions, execute: Mads . help () There are various examples located in the examples directory of the Mads repository. For example, execute include (Mads . madsdir * " /../examples/contamination/contamination.jl " ) to perform various example analyses related to groundwater contaminant transport, or execute include (Mads . madsdir * " /../examples/bigdt/bigdt.jl " ) to perform Bayesian Information Gap Decision Theory (BIG-DT) analysis.
