GadJet.jl This package provides some basic functionality to work with the SPH code "Gadget" by Volker Springel (doi:10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09655.x). These functionalities are: reading and writing data in snapshot format 1+2, reading the subfind output, basic mapping of sph data to a grid. Additionally I provide some exact riemann solvers for shocktube tests, unit conversion and other utility. This list will extend over time. Documentation can be found here Please note that I am not affiliated with Volker Springel. This project was started because I needed to work with Gadget for university and couldn't find any Julia implementations to work with the data. Any help and contribution is greatly appreciated, as this is still a work in progress. Please see the section on contributing. Quickstart Reading Data If you want to read a simulation snapshot into memory with GadJet.jl, it's as easy as this: data = read_snap (filename) This will return a dictionary with the header information in data["Header"] and the blocks sorted by particle type. As an example, this is how you would access the positions of the gas particles: data[ " Parttype0 " ][ " POS " ] If you only want to read a specific block for a single particle type (e.g. positions of gas particles) you can use the function with a specified blockname and particle type like so: pos = read_snap (filename, " POS " , 0 ) This will return an array of the datatype of your simulation, usually Float32. Quick Visualisation For a quick glimpse at your data you can use the glimpse function (yes, I thought hard about this one...) image = glimpse (filename) This will return a 200x200 pixel image of the whole box, centered on the center of mass. If you want to look at a specific range you can provide an array with the center coordinates as center_pos = [x, y, z] and the extent in x, y and z direction with dx, dy, dz . image = glimpse (filename, center_pos, dx, dy, dz) Contributing If you want to contribute to this project I would greatly appreciate your help!

Add unit conversion (in progress).
