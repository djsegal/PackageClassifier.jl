SpatialGrids.jl SpatialGrids provides 2D and 3D grid structures for working with point cloud data. The current grids available are a 2D raster and a sparse voxel grid for working with 3D point cloud. Raster Grid To create a 2D raster grid: using SpatialGrids points = rand ( 3 , 100000 ) * 20.0 raster = rasterize_points (points, 0.1 ) Sparse Voxel Grid To create a sparse voxel grid with voxel side length of 10 metres for arbitrary points: using SpatialGrids points = rand ( 3 , 100000 ) * 20.0 grid = SparseVoxelGrid (points, 10.0 ) The created grid is an iteratable object that returns a Voxel at each index. Each voxel can be accessed directly with a for loop or all voxels can be collect ed into an array. Likewise, the returned Voxel is an iterable object that returns the point indices. # Iterate through each voxel in grid for voxel in grid # Get each point index in voxel for idx in voxel # Do stuff with points[:,idx] end # Or, you may want all point indices in a voxel all_point_indices = collect (voxel) end
