Plotly.jl A Julia interface to the plot.ly plotting library and cloud services Install Simply run Pkg.add("Plotly") . Usage Plotting functions provided by this package are identical to PlotlyJS . Please consult its documentation . For example, this will display a basic scatter plot: my_plot = plot([scatter(x=[1,2], y=[3,4])], Layout(title="My plot")) Using the Plotly cloud New user signup Find your username and API key in the Plotly settings . Signin julia > Plotly . signin ( " username " , " your api key " ) PlotlyAccount ( " username " , " your api key " ) Note: you may also specify your session endpoints using sign in as follows: julia > Plotly . signin ( " username " , " your api key " , Dict ( " plotly_domain " => " your_plotly_base_endpoint " , " plotly_api_domain " => " your_plotly_api_endpoint " )) Saving your credentials julia > Plotly . set_credentials_file ( Dict ( " username " => " your_user_name " , " api_key " => " your_api_key " )) Note: your credentials will be saved within /YOUR_HOME_DIR/.plotly/.credentials Saving your endpoint configuration julia > Plotly . set_config_file ( Dict ( " plotly_domain " => " your_plotly_base_endpoint " , " plotly_api_domain " => " your_plotly_api_endpoint " )) Note: your configuration will be saved within /YOUR_HOME_DIR/.plotly/.config Saving a plot to the cloud Use the post function to upload a local plot to the Plotly cloud: > my_plot = plot([scatter(y=[1,2])]) > remote_plot = post(my_plot) Plotly.RemotePlot(URI(https://plot.ly/~malmaud/73)) Visiting https://plot.ly/~malmaud/73 in a browser will show the plot. Download a plot from the cloud Use the download function with a remote plot object to download a plot stored on the Plotly cloud to a local Plot object: local_plot = download(RemotePlot("https://plot.ly/~malmaud/73")) # or equivalently, local_plot = download_plot("https://plot.ly/~malmaud/73") Acknowledgements PlotlyJS.jl , which provides the large majority of the functionality of this package, is developed primarily by Spencer Lyon. This package, which adds to PlotlyJS.jl the functionality for interacting with the Plotly cloud, is developed by Jon Malmaud and others. Contribute Please do! This is an open source project.
