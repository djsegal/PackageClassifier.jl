AugmentedGaussianProcesses.jl is a Julia package in development for Data Augmented Sparse Gaussian Processes . It contains a collection of models for different gaussian and non-gaussian likelihoods , which are transformed via data augmentation into conditionally conjugate likelihood allowing for extremely fast inference via block coordinate updates. There are also more options to use more traditional variational inference via quadrature or Monte Carlo integration. You can also use the package in Python via PyJulia ! Packages models : Two GP classification likelihood BayesianSVM : A Classifier with a likelihood equivalent to the classic SVM IJulia example / Reference Logistic : A Classifier with a Bernoulli likelihood with the logistic link IJulia example / Reference Four GP Regression likelihood Gaussian : The standard Gaussian Process regression model with a Gaussian Likelihood (no data augmentation was needed here) IJulia example / Reference StudentT : The standard Gaussian Process regression with a Student-t likelihood (the degree of freedom ν is not optimizable for the moment) IJulia example / Reference Laplace : Gaussian Process regression with a Laplace likelihood IJulia example /(No reference at the moment) Heteroscedastic : Regression with non-stationary noise, given by an additional GP. (no reference at the moment) Two GP event counting likelihoods Discrete Poisson Process : Estimating a the Poisson parameter λ at every point (as λ₀σ(f)). (no reference at the moment) Negative Binomial : Estimating the success probability at every point for a negative binomial distribution (no reference at the miment) One Multi-Class Classification Likelihood Logistic-SoftMax : A modified version of the softmax where the exponential is replaced by the logistic function IJulia example / Reference Multi-Ouput models It is also possible to create a multi-ouput model where the outputs are a linear combination of inducing variables see IJulia example in preparation /[Reference][neuripsmultiouput] More models in development Probit : A Classifier with a Bernoulli likelihood with the probit link Online : Allowing for all algorithms to work online as well Install the package The package requires at least Julia 1.1 Run julia , press ] and type add AugmentedGaussianProcesses , it will install the package and all its dependencies. Use the package A complete documentation is available in the docs . For a short start now you can use this very basic example where X_train is a matrix N x D where N is the number of training points and D is the number of dimensions and Y_train is a vector of outputs (or matrix of independent outputs). using AugmentedGaussianProcesses; using KernelFunctions model = SVGP (X_train,Y_train, SqExponentialKernel ( 1.0 ), LogisticLikelihood (), AnalyticSVI ( 100 ), 64 ) train! (model, 100 ) Y_predic = predict_y (model,X_test) # For getting the label directly Y_predic_prob, Y_predic_prob_var = proba_y (model,X_test) # For getting the likelihood (and likelihood uncertainty) of predicting class 1 Both documentation and examples/tutorials are available.
