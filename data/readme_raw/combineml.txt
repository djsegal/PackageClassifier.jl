CombineML Julia 1.0/Linux/OSX: CombineML is a heterogeneous ensemble learning package for the Julia programming language. It is driven by a uniform machine learner API designed for learner composition. Getting Started See the notebook for demo: MetaModeling.ipnyb We will cover how to predict on a dataset using CombineML. Obtain Data A tabular dataset will be used to obtain our features and labels. This will be split it into a training and test set using holdout method. import CombineML using CombineML . Util using CombineML . Transformers try import RDatasets catch using Pkg Pkg . add ( " RDatasets " ) import RDatasets end # use shorter module names CU = CombineML . Util CT = CombineML . Transformers RD = RDatasets # Obtain features and labels dataset = RD . dataset ( " datasets " , " iris " ) features = convert (Matrix,dataset[:, 1 : ( end - 1 )]) labels = convert (Array,dataset[:, end ]) # Split into training and test sets (train_ind, test_ind) = CU . holdout ( size (features, 1 ), 0.3 ) Create a Learner A transformer processes features in some form. Coincidentally, a learner is a subtype of transformer. A transformer can be created by instantiating it, taking an options dictionary as an optional argument. All transformers, including learners are called in the same way. # Learner with default settings learner = CT . PrunedTree () # Learner with some of the default settings overriden learner = CT . PrunedTree ( Dict ( :impl_options => Dict ( :purity_threshold => 1.0 ) )) # All learners are called in the same way. learner = CT . StackEnsemble ( Dict ( :learners => [ CT . PrunedTree (), CT . RandomForest (), CT . DecisionStumpAdaboost () ], :stacker => CT . RandomForest () )) Create a Pipeline Normally we may require the use of data pre-processing before the features are passed to the learner. We shall use a pipeline transformer to chain many transformers in sequence. In this case we shall one hot encode categorical features, impute NA values and numerically standardize before we call the learner. # Create pipeline pipeline = CT . Pipeline ( Dict ( :transformers => [ CT . OneHotEncoder (), # Encodes nominal features into numeric CT . Imputer (), # Imputes NA values CT . StandardScaler (), # Standardizes features learner # Predicts labels on features ] )) Train and Predict Training is done via the fit! function, predicton via transform! . All transformers, provide these two functions. They are always called the same way. # Train CT . fit! (pipeline, features[train_ind, :], labels[train_ind]) # Predict predictions = CT . transform! (pipeline, features[test_ind, :]) Assess Finally we assess how well our learner performed. # Assess predictions result = CU . score ( :accuracy , labels[test_ind], predictions) Available Transformers Outlined are all the transformers currently available via CombineML. CombineML Baseline (CombineML.jl Learner) Baseline learner that by default assigns the most frequent label. try import StatsBase catch using Pkg Pkg . add ( " StatsBase " ) import StatsBase end learner = CT .

PrunedTree (), CT . DecisionStumpAdaboost (), CT . RandomForest ()], # Options grid for learners, to search through by BestLearner. # Format is [learner_1_options, learner_2_options, ...] # where learner_options is same as a learner's options but # with a list of values instead of scalar. :learner_options_grid => nothing )) OneHotEncoder (CombineML.jl Transformer) Transforms nominal features into one-hot form and coerces the instance matrix to be of element type Float64. transformer = CT .
