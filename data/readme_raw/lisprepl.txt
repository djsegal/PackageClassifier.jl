LispREPL.jl: A REPL for LispSyntax.jl This package provides REPL functionality with Lisp syntax on top of julia. This is really Michael Hatherly's contribution factored out of LispSyntax.jl. Usage The lisp REPL mode is entered using the ) key in a same way as other REPL modes such as help ( ? ) and shell ( ; ). Unlike those modes the lisp mode is "sticky". After pressing return to evaluate the current line the mode will not switch back to the julia> mode, but instead will remain in lisp mode. To return to Julia mode press backspace. Customization The lisp mode prompt text and color may be set via your ENV settings. For example adding the following to your .juliarc.jl : ENV[ " LISP_PROMPT_TEXT " ] = " Î» " ENV[ " LISP_PROMPT_COLOR " ] = " red " will set the prompt for lisp mode to a red lambda.
