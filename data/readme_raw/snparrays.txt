SnpArrays.jl Documentation Build Status Code Coverage Citation Routines for reading and manipulating compressed storage of biallelic SNP (Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism) data. Data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are often saved as a PLINK binary biallelic genotype table or .bed file. To be useful, such files should be accompanied by a .fam file, containing metadata on the rows of the table, and a .bim file, containing metadata on the columns. The .fam and .bim files are in tab-separated format. Installation This package requires Julia v0.7 or later, which can be obtained from https://julialang.org/downloads/ or by building Julia from the sources in the https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia repository. The package has not yet been registered and must be installed using the repository location.
