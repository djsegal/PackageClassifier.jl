InlineExports.jl Decentralizing exports in Julia Usage InlineExports provides the convenience macro, @export , for exporting names in a module at the location of definition, as an alternative to the convention of exporting names at the top of the module. @export analyses an expression for definitions of variables, functions or types, and inserts an appropriate export statement above. This is illustrated by the following example: module M using InlineExports @export struct T{ ... } ... end function f (x) ... end """ g(x) ... """ @export function g (x) ... end end The module above will export the names T and g . Alternatively, definitions can be wrapped inside a block. The example below will export both a , b and c : module M using InlineExports @export begin a = 1 const b = 2 c = 3 end end
