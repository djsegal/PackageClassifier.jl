Analysis of synchronous signals This package implements efficient multitaper and continuous wavelet transforms, along with the following transform statistics most of which operate on pairs of signals: Power spectral density ( PowerSpectrum ) Power spectral density variance ( PowerSpectrumVariance ) Cross spectrum ( CrossSpectrum ) Coherence ( Coherence for the absolute value, Coherency for the complex value) Phase locking value, a.k.a. the mean resultant vector length or R̄ ( PLV ) Pairwise phase consistency, a.k.a. the unbiased estimator of R̄^2 ( PPC ) Phase lag index ( PLI ) Unbiased squared phase lang index ( PLI2Unbiased ) Weighted phase lag index ( WPLI ) Debiased squared weighted phase lag index ( WPLI2Debiased ) Jammalamadaka circular correlation coefficient ( JCircularCorrelation ) Jupp-Mardia squared circular correlation coefficient ( JMCircularCorrelation ) Hurtado et al. modulation index (phase-amplitude coupling) ( HurtadoModulationIndex ) Additionally, the following point-field measures are implemented: Point-field coherence ( pfcoherence ) Point-field PLV ( pfplv ) Point-field PPC, variants 0, 1, and 2 ( pfppc0 , pfppc1 , pfppc2 ) And the following point-point measures: Point-point cross correlation ( pfxcorr ) All measures except for the point-field measures have corresponding unit tests.
