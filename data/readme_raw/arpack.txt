Arpack Julia wrapper for the arpack library designed to solve large scale eigenvalue problems. Installation You can install Arpack.jl through the Julia package manager: julia > Pkg . add ( " Arpack " ) Arpack.jl will use BinaryProvider.jl to automatically install the Arpack binaries. Custom Installation If you get ERROR: LoadError: LibraryProduct(nothing, ["libarpack"], :libarpack, "Prefix(~/.julia/packages/Arpack/cu5By/deps/usr)") is not satisfied, cannot generate deps.jl! when building Arpack, it may be because your Julia installation uses your system blas for which the symbols are not suffixed by _64_ while this is required by the compiled binaries provided by BinaryProvider.jl . This is notably the case on ArchLinux . In these case, compile binaries that do not require this suffix as follows. Download the source of the v3.5.0 of arpack-ng , extract it in some <directory> , build it and do (note that you may need to update cu6By to match the one printed in the error message printed above). $ cp <directory>/arpack-ng-3.5.0/SRC/.libs/libarpack.so.2.0.0 ~/.julia/packages/Arpack/cu5By/deps/usr/lib/ $ julia -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.build("Arpack")' Building Arpack â†’ `~/.julia/packages/Arpack/UiiMc/deps/build.log`
