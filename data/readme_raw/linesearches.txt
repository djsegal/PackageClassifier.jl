LineSearches Description This package provides an interface to line search algorithms implemented in Julia. The code was originally written as part of Optim , but has now been separated out to its own package. Available line search algorithms In the docs we show how to choose between the line search algorithms in Optim . HagerZhang (Taken from the Conjugate Gradient implementation by Hager and Zhang, 2006) MoreThuente (From the algorithm in More and Thuente, 1994) BackTracking (Described in Nocedal and Wright, 2006) StrongWolfe (Nocedal and Wright) Static (Takes the proposed initial step length.) Available initial step length procedures The package provides some procedures to calculate the initial step length that is passed to the line search algorithm. See the docs for its usage in Optim . InitialPrevious (Use the step length from the previous optimization iteration) InitialStatic (Use the same initial step length each time) InitialHagerZhang (Taken from Hager and Zhang, 2006) InitialQuadratic (Propose initial step length based on a quadratic interpolation) InitialConstantChange (Propose initial step length assuming constant change in step length) Documentation For more details and options, see the documentation STABLE — most recently tagged version of the documentation. LATEST — in-development version of the documentation. Example usage Here is how to get a simple linesearch for a one-dimensional function working: using LineSearches ϕ(x) = (x - π) ^ 4 dϕ(x) = 4 * (x - π) ^ 3 ϕdϕ(x) = ϕ(x),dϕ(x) α 0 = 9.0 ϕ 0 = ϕ( 0.0 ) dϕ 0 = dϕ( 0.0 ) for ls in (Static,BackTracking,HagerZhang,MoreThuente,StrongWolfe) res = ( ls ())(ϕ, dϕ, ϕdϕ, α 0 , ϕ 0 ,dϕ 0 ) println (ls, " : " , res) end For more examples, see the documentation.
