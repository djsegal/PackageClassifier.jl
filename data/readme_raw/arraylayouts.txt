ArrayLayouts.jl A Julia package for describing array layouts and more general fast linear algebra This package implements a trait-based framework for describing array layouts such as column major, row major, etc. that can be dispatched to appropriate BLAS or optimised Julia linear algebra routines. This supports a much wider class of matrix types than Julia's in-built StridedArray . Here is an example: julia > using ArrayLayouts julia > A = randn ( 10_000 , 10_000 ); x = randn ( 10_000 ); y = similar (x); julia > V = view ( Symmetric (A),:,:) ' ; julia > @time mul! (y, A, x); # Julia does not recognize that V is symmetric 0.040255 seconds ( 4 allocations : 160 bytes) julia > @time muladd! ( 1.0 , V, x, 0.0 , y); # ArrayLayouts does and is 3x faster as it calls BLAS 0.017677 seconds ( 4 allocations : 160 bytes)
