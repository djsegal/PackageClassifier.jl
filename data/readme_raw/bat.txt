BAT.jl Welcome to BAT, the Bayesian analysis toolkit. This is a rewrite of the previous C++-BAT in Julia. BAT.jl provides several improvements over it's C++ predecessor, but has not reached feature parity yet in some areas. BAT.jl currently includes: Metropolis-Hastings MCMC sampling Adaptive Harmonic Mean Integration ( AHMI ) Plotting recipes for MCMC samples and statistics Additional sampling algorithms and other features are in preparation. Installation To install BAT.jl, start Julia and run julia > using Pkg julia > pkg " add BAT " Documentation Documentation for stable version Documentation for development version Citing BAT.jl When using BAT.jl for work that will result in a scientific publication, please cite Caldwell et al., BAT.jl - A Bayesian Analysis Toolkit in Julia , doi:10.5281/zenodo.2605312 The DOI above is version-independent , you may want to use the DOI of the specific BAT.jl version used in your work.
