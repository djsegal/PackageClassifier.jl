CompilerOptions This is a basic package for providing introsepction into Julia's compiler options. This functionality is now part of Base in 0.4, so this package aims provide a consistent API between 0.3 and 0.4. Use Julia 0.3 CompilerOptions defines the following for Julia 0.3: immutable JLOptions build_path::Ptr{Cchar} cpu_target::Ptr{Cchar} code_coverage::Int8 malloc_log::Int8 check_bounds::Int8 int_literals::Cint end JLOptions() = unsafe_load(cglobal(:jl_compileropts, JLOptions)) For example, it is now possible to see if Julia is being run with code-coverage enabled: JLOptions().code_coverage Julia 0.4 Julia 0.4 provides the same type, but is unexported. This package simply provides an alias for the function in Base: JLOptions() = Base.JLOptions() Credit This package was kick started with the help of ihnorton, jakebolewski, and staticfloat. https://gist.github.com/staticfloat/93d7050a08ff7bb52373 https://groups.google.com/d/msg/julia-users/TkYi6CJrSVE/L-ydZ67ujiUJ License Available under the MIT "Expat" License .
