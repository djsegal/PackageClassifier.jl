PolynomialBases A library of functions for polynomial bases used in spectral element methods using the quadrature rules from FastGaussQuadrature.jl for Float64 and root finding via the Newton algorithm for other scalar types (such as BigFloat ). The algorithms for interpolation and differentiation use barycentric weights as described in the book "Implementing Spectral Methods for PDEs" by David Kopriva. If SymPy.jl / SymEngine.jl is loaded, symbolic computations using SymPy.Sym / SymEngine.Basic are supported. A brief tutorial is given as notebook .
