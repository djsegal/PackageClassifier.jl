TestImages This package provides a convenient Julia interface for loading standard named test images . This can be used in conjunction with the Images package. Documentation Full documentation and description of the images available in TestImages.jl can be found here . Installation TestImages doesn't support image IO by itself, which means you need to install some backends on your choice, e.g., ImageMagick.jl , QuartzImageIO , OMETIFF.jl . Usage using TestImages img = testimage("cameraman.tif") # fullname img = testimage("cameraman) # without extension works img = testimage("cam") # with only partial name also works Images will be automatically downloaded into artifact folders (e.g., images/ for julia < v1.3 ) when you load the image for the first time. Contributing A detailed guide on contributing to TestImages.jl can be found in the documentation mentioned above.
