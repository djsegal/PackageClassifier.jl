ZygoteRules.jl This is a minimal (<100sloc) package which enables you to add custom gradients to Zygote, without depending on Zygote itself. Usage: foo (a, b) = a * b using ZygoteRules @adjoint foo (a, b) = a * b, c̄ -> (b ' c̄, a ' c̄) See the Zygote docs for more details on how to write custom gradients.
