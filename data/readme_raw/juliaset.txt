Juliaset Generate Julia set images. This is created primarily as an example for JuliaBox hosted REST APIs. To use this as a REST API with JuliaBox : Login to JuliaBox Open the JuliaBox settings tab (click the wrench icon on top right) Go to the section that says Published APIs . If you don't see it, it's probably not enabled for you. Please write to admin@juliabox.org or leave a message in the JuliaBox forum and someone will enable it for you. Register a new API: think of a unique API name ( <your_name>_juliaset is probably a good choice) use the following as command: Pkg.clone("https://github.com/tanmaykm/Juliaset.jl.git"); using Juliaset; Juliaset.serve_juliabox(); point the description URL to somewhere nice (or maybe to https://github.com/tanmaykm/Juliaset.jl ) Your REST API is now ready. Try the following URLs on your browser. Replace <api_name> with your chosen name. https://api.juliabox.org/<api_name>/juliaset/ to get a random Julia set https://api.juliabox.org/<api_name>/juliaset/<random_float>/<another_random_float> to get one of your choice
