InteractBulma Package to create Bulma themes to style Interact apps with Bulma css. To learn how to use Interact, check out the Interact documentation . Theming instruction InteractBulma provides a compile_theme function to create a theme (a CSS file) based on variables and overrides. Check out the Bulma documentation to learn what variables can be used and how. The function compile_theme(output) has two optional keyword arguments ( variables and overrides ) with the path of the scss file you want to use to customize variables or to add overrides respectively. output=mktempdir() is the folder chosen to store the resulting css files (main.css and main_confined.css). Example usage Here we will use variables from the flatly theme: using Interact using InteractBulma : compile_theme, examplefolder variables_file = joinpath (examplefolder, " flatly " , " _variables.scss " ) # here you would use your own style mytheme = compile_theme (variables = variables_file) settheme! (mytheme) button () # test the new looks of Interact widgets
