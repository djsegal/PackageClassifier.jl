Features ‚Ä¢ Installation ‚Ä¢ News ‚Ä¢ Citing ‚Ä¢ Contributing This is a Julia implementation of the Conic operator splitting method (COSMO) solver. It can solve large convex conic optimization problems of the following form: with decision variables x œµ R^n , s œµ R^m and data matrices P=P'>=0 , q œµ R^n , A œµ R^(m√ón) , and b œµ R^m . The convex set K is a composition of convex sets and cones. For more information take a look at the COSMO.jl Documentation ( stable | dev ). Features Versatile : COSMO solves linear programs, quadratic programs, second-order cone programs, semidefinite programs and problems involving exponential and power cones Quad SDPs : Positive semidefinite programs with quadratic objective functions are natively supported Infeasibility detection : Infeasible problems are detected without a homogeneous self-dual embedding of the problem JuMP support : COSMO supports MathOptInterface and JuMP, which allows you to describe your problem in JuMP Warm starting : COSMO supports warm starting of the decision variables Custom sets and linear solver : Customize COSMO's components by defining your own convex constraint sets and by choosing from a number of direct and indirect linear system solvers, e.g. QDLDL , Pardiso , Conjugate Gradient and MINRES Open Source : Our code is free to use and distributed under the Apache 2.0 Licence Chordal decomposition : COSMO tries to decompose large structured PSD constraints using chordal decomposition techniques. This often results in a significant speedup compared to the original problem. Smart clique merging : After an initial decomposition of a structured SDP, COSMO recombines overlapping cliques/blocks to speed up the algorithm.
