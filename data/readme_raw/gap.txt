GAP.jl Julia module This repository contains the GAP.jl Julia module, as well as the GAP packages JuliaInterface and JuliaExperimental developed for the GAP - Julia integration as part of the OSCAR project . Install To install this module in Julia, use ] add https://github.com/oscar-system/GAP.jl Basic usage After entering the following in Julia, using GAP one may call any GAP function by prefixing its name with GAP.Globals. . For example: julia > GAP . Globals . SymmetricGroup ( 3 ) GAP : SymmetricGroup ( [ 1 .. 3 ] ) The Julia types Int64 and Bool are automatically converted to GAP objects. Several others types of objects can be converted using GAP.julia_to_gap : julia > x = GAP . julia_to_gap ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) GAP : [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] Converting back to Julia is done using GAP.gap_to_julia . However, for this one needs to specify the desired type of the resulting object. For example, to convert the GAP list of integers we just defined back to Julia, we might do this: julia > GAP . gap_to_julia (Array{Int64, 1 }, x) 3 - element Array{Int64, 1 } : 1 2 3 General Disclaimer All code in this repository is preliminary work.
