BSplines This package provides data types and functions for working with B-splines as a means to approximate real functions. For its usage, see the documentation . This package is not related to the package at https://github.com/gusl/BSplines.jl . While gusl/BSplines.jl is only compatible with Julia ≤ 0.4, this package works with Julia ≥ 1.0. Installation This package is compatible with Julia ≥ 1.0. It can be installed by typing ] add BSplines in the Julia REPL. Acknowledgments The algorithms used for evaluating B-splines and their derivatives are adapted from the Fortran code found in Carl de Boor’s book A practical Guide to Splines [1] , in particular from the subroutines BSPLVB , BSPLVD and BVALUE .
