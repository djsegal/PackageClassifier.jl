FilePaths.jl FilePaths.jl provides a type based approach to working with filesystem paths in julia. Intallation: FilePaths.jl is registered, so you can to use Pkg.add to install it. julia > Pkg . add ( " FilePaths " ) Usage: julia > using FilePaths The first important difference about working with paths in FilePaths.jl is that a path is an immutable list (Tuple) of strings, rather than simple a string. Path creation: julia > Path ( " ~/repos/FilePaths.jl/ " ) Paths . PosixPath (( " ~ " , " repos " , " FilePaths.jl " , " " )) or julia > p " ~/repos/FilePaths.jl/ " Paths . PosixPath (( " ~ " , " repos " , " FilePaths.jl " , " " )) Human readable file status info: julia > stat ( p " README.md " ) Status ( device = 16777220 , inode = 48428965 , mode = - rw - r -- r -- , nlink = 1 , uid = 501 , gid = 20 , rdev = 0 , size = 1880 ( 1.8 K), blksize = 4096 ( 4.0 K), blocks = 8 , mtime = 2016 - 02 - 16 T00 : 49 : 27 , ctime = 2016 - 02 - 16 T00 : 49 : 27 , ) Working with permissions: julia > m = mode ( p " README.md " ) - rw - r -- r -- julia > m - readable ( :ALL ) -- w ------- julia > m + executable ( :ALL ) - rwxr - xr - x julia > chmod ( p " README.md " , " +x " ) julia > mode ( p " README.md " ) - rwxr - xr - x julia > chmod ( p " README.md " , m) julia > m = mode ( p " README.md " ) - rw - r -- r -- julia > chmod ( p " README.md " , user = (READ + WRITE + EXEC), group = (READ + WRITE), other = READ) julia > mode ( p " README.md " ) - rwxrw - r -- Reading and writing directly to file paths: julia > write ( p " testfile " , " foobar " ) 6 julia > read ( p " testfile " ) " foobar " All the standard methods for working with paths in base julia exist in the FilePaths.jl. The following describes the rough mapping of method names. Use ? at the REPL to get the documentation and arguments as they may be different than the base implementations.
