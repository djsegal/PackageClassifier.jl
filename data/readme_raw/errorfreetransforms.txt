ErrorFreeTransforms Rounding errors are a common problem in floating point arithmetic. For a pair of floating point numbers a , b , an error-free transformation (EFT) is an operation that maps (a, b) into (x, y) , where a ○ b = x + y and x = fl(a ○ b) with ○ being either addition, subtraction or multiplication. Standard EFTs are the TwoSum algorithm by Knuth (implemented as err_add ) and the TwoProd algorithm by Dekker (implemented as err_mul ). This package implements several EFTs from the scientific literature. Current status This project is still very much a work in progress. It requires a recent build of Julia 0.4 to work.
