RTLSDR A wrapper for the librtlsdr C libraries. Currently, this only works on Linux (I think). You need to download the librtlsdr libraries. This code is heavily based off the pyrtlsdr libary by github user roger- . librtlsdr C libraries Julia needs to find librtlsdr.so somewhere on your system. To see if Julia can find it, you can use find_library : using Libdl find_library ( " librtlsdr " ) # returns empty string if library not found You can also type the following into an Ubuntu shell to help find it: ldconfig -p | grep librtlsdr Quick Example using RTLSDR r = RtlSdr () set_rate (r, 2.0e6 ) set_freq (r, 88.5e6 ) # if we wanted the center freq on NPR samples = read_samples (r, 1024 ) # plot power spectral density using PyPlot psd (samples) Function list r = RtlSdr () # creates RtlSdr object with dongle pointer set_rate (r, rate_Hz) # rtlsdr_set_sample_rate get_rate (r) set_freq (r, freq_Hz) # rtlsdr_set_center_freq get_freq (r) set_agc_mode (r, mode) # rtlsdr_set_agc_mode set_tuner_gain_mode (r, manual) # rtlsdr_set_tuner_gain_mode close (r) # rtlsdr_close. cannot read from r once this is called # rtlsdr_read_sync # returns vector of length num_bytes with Uint8 (bytes) # num_bytes must be multiple of 512 read_bytes (r, num_bytes) # converts vector of Uint8 into a vector (half as long) of complex iq samples packed_bytes_to_iq (bytes) # equivalent to read_bytes + packed_bytes_to_iq # returns a vector of length num_samples with complex samples # num_samples must be multiple of 256 read_samples (r, num_samples)
