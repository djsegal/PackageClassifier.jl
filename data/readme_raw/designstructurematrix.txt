DesignStructureMatrix.jl What is Design Structure Matrix? D esign S tructure M atrix ( DSM ), also called D ependency S tructure M atrix, is a simple and useful method to represent complex system architectures or projects. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_structure_matrix What is DesignStructureMarix.jl? This package, DesignStructureMatrix offers tools for displaying and analysing DSM. For now, plotting DSM, clustering DSM and sequencing DSM are available. Installation In Pkg mode( Please hit ] ) (v1.1) pkg> add DesignStructureMatrix When you use this package, please type julia> using DesignStructureMatrix Displaying DSM you need to prepare adjacency matrix A for systems or projects. for example # #this is adjacency matrix A = [ 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 ; 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ; 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ; 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ; 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 ; 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ; 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 ] then 7 × 7 Array{Int64, 2 } : 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 next, you need to prepare label for elements in this adjacency matrix. label = [ " A " , " B " , " C " , " D " , " E " , " F " , " G " ] then 6 - element Array{String, 1 } : " A " " B " " C " " D " " E " " F " To display DSM, please type plotDSM (A,label) then Clustering DSM One of useful ways for analysing DSM is Clustering. Original DSM is below original_DSM = [ 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 ; 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 ; 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 ; 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 ; 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ; 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 ; 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 ]; original_label = [ " A " , " B " , " C " , " D " , " E " , " F " , " G " ]; plotDSM (original_DSM,original_label) original_DSM To get Clustered DSM, please type clustered_DSM, clustered_label = Clustering (original_DSM,original_label) and plotDSM (clustered_DSM,clustered_label) then, you get clustered DSM Sequencing DSM Another way for analysing DSM is seaquencing. Original DSM is below original_DSM = [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 ; 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 ; 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ; 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 ; 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ; 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 ; 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ; 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 ; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ; 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 ]; original_label = [ " 1 " , " 2 " , " 3 " , " 4 " , " 5 " , " 6 " , " 7 " , " 8 " , " 9 " , " 10 " , " 11 " , " 12 " , " 13 " ]; plotDSM (original_DSM,original_label) original DSM To get Sequenced DSM, please type sequenced_DSM, sequenced_label = Sequencing (original_DSM, original_label); plotDSM (sequenced_DSM, sequenced_label) then, you get sequenced DSM Future Improve plotting DSM Implement Other algorithm for clustering DSM Implement Other algorithm for sequencing DSM Display D omain M apping M atrices ( DMMs ), and M ulti D omain M atrices ( MDMs ) Dependency packages Gadfly.jl LinearLinearAlgebra.jl Reference Clustering algorithm Figueiredo Damásio, J., Almeida Bittencourt, R., Dario, D., & Guerrero, S.
