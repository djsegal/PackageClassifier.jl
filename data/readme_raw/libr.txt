LiBr (aqueous lithium bromide) Property Routines The property routines described here are for the aqueous salt mixture LiBr/H2O. These routines were developed primarily as a part of the Sorption Systems Consortium at the University of Maryland. The basic rotuines are provided in an external library named LiBrSSC.dll. The routines available in this library are listed in Table 1. The units of the properties must be as specified. Table 1.

This was done as part of the SSC efforts but was unpublished [1]. Details of the correlations are summarized here Viscosity $$lnμ=A_0+A_1X^2+\frac{B_0}{T}+\frac{B_1X^2}{T}+\frac{C_0}{T}+\frac{C_1X^2}{T}$$ where the units are μ (cP), T (K), X (mass fraction LiBr) and the constants are Coef0 Coef1 Ao = -2.3212641667148 A1 = 3.190587778753 Bo = -609.44957160372 B1 = 963.16370163469 Co = 372994.85578423 C1 = -35211.99698739 This equation yields a $R^2$ value of 0.984073 across all of the data sets used. Example calculation: T = 25°C (298.15 K), X = 50% ➡ μ = 3.807 cP.

There were equations that had higher R2 values but the one shown above had the best combination of properties. Example calculation: T = 25°C (298.15 K), X = 50% k = 0.444 W/m-K. Index of Refraction The index of refraction of aqueous lithium bromide can be calculated from the correlation of Bostick et al. [2] $$N=N_1X^2+N_2X+N_3T+N_4$$ where i $N_i$ 1 0.0000241 2 0.00108 3 -0.000106 4 1.3348 Units: T - °C, x – mass fraction LiBr in % Crystallization Temperature The crystallization temperature is calculated from a curve fit to the data of Boryta [3]. $$x=A_0+A_1T+A_2T^2$$ i Ai 65.05 < x < 71.91 57.08 < x < 65.05 48.47 < x < 57.08 0 62.63716 56.95202 56.55952 1 0.04810823 0.05205944 0.2337275 2 0.00024301 0.00346278 0.00141297 Units: T - °C, x – mass fraction LiBr in % Thermodynamic Properties The thermodynamic properties include volume, enthalpy, specific heat, entropy and chemical potential as well as the saturation properties temperature and pressure. All of these properties are derived from a Gibbs function fitted to a broad set of data for the mixture. The advantage of this approach is that any thermodynamic property of interest can be easily derived from the Gibbs function. And a corollary is that all of the derived properties will be thermodynamically consistent (up to the precision of the calculation). The details of the Gibbs function are available in the literature [4, 5]. It provides excellent fidelity with the available data over the full concentration range from pure water up to crystallization and from 0 – 300°C. Enthalpy of Aqueous Lithium Bromide h = libr_h(T,x) or h = libr_h(T,x,P) In general, we expect three independent properties to be required to specify state for a binary mixture such as aqueous lithium bromide. However, because the pressure effect is usually small, it is often omitted from property correlations for this mixture. The SSC routines retain and calculate pressure effects. However, to simplify routine use where the pressure effects can be ignored, the SSC enthalpy routine has an overload feature which calculates (and uses) the saturation pressure for cases where the user does not input a pressure value. Example calculation: T = 25°C (298.15K), X = 50% ➡ h = 52.92 J/g. Entropy of Aqueous Lithium Bromide s = libr_s(x,T,p) or s = libr_s(x,T,p) Example calculation: T = 25°C (298.15K), X = 50% ➡ s = 0.1853 J/g-K. Specific Heat of Aqueous Lithium Bromide cp = libr_cp(x,T) or cp = libr_cp(x,T,p) Example calculation: T = 25°C (298.15K), X = 50% ➡ cp = 2.151 J/g-K.

It assumes an adiabatic process. Inputs are enthalpy (h), LiBr mass fraction and the pressure at the outlet of the restriction. Outputs are the vapor quality (q), temperature (T), liquid mass fraction (x), liquid enthalpy (hl) and vapor enthalpy (hv). Example calculation: h = 74.54 J/g, P = 0.7 kPa, x_in = 50% ➡ q = 0.009845, T = 23.33°C, xl = 50.49%, hl = 50.38 J/g, hv = 2504.34 J/g.
