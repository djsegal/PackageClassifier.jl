EncodedArrays.jl EncodedArray provides an API for arrays that store their elements in encoded/compressed form. This package is meant to be lightweight and only implements a simple codec VarlenDiffArrayCodec . As codec implementations are often complex and have various dependencies, more advanced codecs should be implemented in separate packages.
