MetadataArrays Implementation of arrays with metadata. Metadata Arrays A MetadataArray is a an Array , together with some metadata. julia > v = [ " John " , " John " , " Jane " , " Louise " ]; julia > s = MetadataArray (v, Dict ( " John " => " Treatment " , " Louise " => " Placebo " , " Jane " => " Placebo " )) 4 - element MetadataArrays . MetadataArray{String,Dict{String,String}, 1 ,Array{String, 1 }} : " John " " John " " Jane " " Louise " The parent AbstractArray as well as the metadata can be recovered with parent and metadata respectively. julia > parent (s) 4 - element Array{String, 1 } : " John " " John " " Jane " " Louise " julia > metadata (s) Dict{String,String} with 3 entries : " John " => " Treatment " " Jane " => " Placebo " " Louise " => " Placebo " metadata is preserved when taking views: julia > metadata ( view (s, 1 : 2 )) Dict{String,String} with 3 entries : " John " => " Treatment " " Jane " => " Placebo " " Louise " => " Placebo " s can be used as a regular AbstractArray (meaning all operations that work on AbstractArray should work on a MetadataArray out of the box.
