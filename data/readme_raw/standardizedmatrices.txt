StandardizedMatrices Statisticians often work with standardized matrices. If x is a data matrix with observations in rows, we want to work with z = StatsBase.zscore(x, 1) . This package defines a StandardizedMatrix type that treats a matrix as standardized without copying or changing data in place. A Motivating Example Suppose our original matrix is sparse and we want to perform matrix-vector multiplication with a standardized version. Typically, standardizing a sparse matrix destroys the sparsity. using StatsBase, BenchmarkTools, StandardizedMatrices, SparseArrays, Statistics # generate some data n, p = 100_000 , 1000 x = sprandn (n, p, .01 ) β = randn (p) xdense = zscore (x, 1 ) # this destroys the sparsity z = StandardizedMatrix (x) # this acts as standardized, but keeps sparse benefits b1 = @benchmark xdense * β b2 = @benchmark z * β ratio ( median (b1), median (b2)) # StandardizedMatrix is roughly 13 times faster Methods implemented: *() mul!(Y, A::StandardizedMatrix, B) mul!(Y, A::Adjoint{<:StandardizedMatrix}, B)
