LassoPlot Linux/MacOS Windows Code LassoPlot.jl is a companion package to Lasso.jl which plots regularization paths in a similar fashion to the glmnet and gamlr R packages. Quick start Install the LassoPlot package. First fit a Lasso path using Lasso, LassoPath path = fit (LassoPath, X, y, dist, link) then plot it plot (path) Use x=:segment , :λ , or :logλ to change the x-axis, as in: plot (path; x = :log λ) LassoPlot uses Plots.jl , so you can choose from several plotting backends. See documentation of the provided plot function for optional arguments (type ?plot in the REPL): help? > plot
