Documentation Build Status HomotopyContinuation.jl is a Julia package for solving systems of polynomial equations by numerical homotopy continuation. See juliahomotopycontinuation.org for installation instructions, full content overview and detailed documentation. Basic usage HomotopyContinuation.jl aims at having easy-to-understand top-level commands. Here is a simple example: using HomotopyContinuation @polyvar x y; # declare the variables x and y result = solve ([x ^ 2 + 2 y, y ^ 2 - 2 ]) Result with 4 solutions ================================== • 4 non-singular solutions (2 real) • 0 singular solutions (0 real) • 4 paths tracked • random seed: 902575 For more see our user guides .
