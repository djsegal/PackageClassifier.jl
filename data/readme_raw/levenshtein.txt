Levenshtein Levenshtein distance between two strings in julia This module provides a simple, but generic implementation of the Levenshtein distance function. Installation julia > Pkg . add ( " Levenshtein " ) Usage Standard Levenshtein distance julia > levenshtein ( " polynomial " , " exponential " ) 6 Levenshtein distance with custom insertion, deletion, substitution costs julia > ins, del, sub = 3 , 2 , 1 ( 3 , 2 , 1 ) julia > levenshtein ( " polynomial " , " exponential " , ins, del, sub) 8
