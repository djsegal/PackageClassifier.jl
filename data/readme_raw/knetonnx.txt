KnetOnnx reads an ONNX file and creates the corresponding Model in Knet that can be re-designed, re-trained or simply used for inference. If you are planning to move your models from PyTorch or Tensorflow to Knet, or simply desiring to play with popular pre-trained neural networks: KnetOnnx provides that functionality. Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is a community project created by Facebook and Microsoft. It provides a definition of an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of built-in operators and standard data types. Operators are implemented externally to the graph, but the set of built-in operators are portable across frameworks. Every framework supporting ONNX will provide implementations of these operators on the applicable data types. Although not all operations are implemented yet, visit ONNX's model zoo to download pre-trained, state-of-the-art models in the ONNX format. Once you download the ONNX file, call KnetModel() with the ONNX file's path to create the model. Tutorial Here is how you create the Knet model corresponding to an ONNX file and perform a forward pass: using KnetOnnx # provide the ONNX file's path model = KnetModel ( " vgg16.onnx " ); # dummy input for prediction x = ones ( 224 , 224 , 3 , 10 ) # call KnetModel object with the model input model (x) # the output is a 1000Ã—10 Array{Float32,2} Supported Operations ReLU LeakyReLU Conv MaxPool Dropout Flatten Gemm Add BatchNormalization ImageScaler RNN Unsqueeze Squeeze Concatenate ConstantOfShape Shape Constant Collaboration Here are some cool ideas if you want to collaborate: Export functionality. This would be a tough problem so feel free to get in contact. Adding a new KnetLayer. Adding a new Converter: (ONNX Operator -> KnetLayer) Testing ONNX models from the zoo and sending bug reports.
