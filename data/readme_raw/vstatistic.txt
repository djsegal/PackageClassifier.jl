v-statistic Implements the v-statistic, a measure that compares the estimation accuracy of the ordinary least squares estimator against a random benchmark. See the paper here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23661222/ which features an implementation in R. I also wrote a python version, see here . install and run install with Pkg.add("VStatistic") run with import VStatistic: vstat, sample_size vstat(120, 4, .05) # get v-statistic sample_size(3, .05, v=.9) # get needed (total n, n per predictor)
