GasModels.jl Release: Dev: GasModels.jl is a Julia/JuMP package for Steady-State Gas Network Optimization. It is designed to enable computational evaluation of emerging Gas network formulations and algorithms in a common platform. The code is engineered to decouple problem specifications (e.g. Gas Flow, Expansion planning, ...) from the gas network formulations (e.g. MINLP, MISOCP, ...). This enables the definition of a wide variety of gas network formulations and their comparison on common problem specifications. Core Problem Specifications Gas Flow (gf) Expansion Planning (ne) Load Shed (ls) Core Network Formulations MINLP NLP MISOCP MIP LP Basic Usage Once GasModels is installed, a optimizer is installed, and a network data file has been acquired, a Gas Flow can be executed with, using GasModels using <solver_package> run_gf("foo.m", FooGasModel, FooSolver()) Similarly, an expansion optimizer can be executed with, run_ne("foo.m", FooGasModel, FooSolver()) where FooGasModel is the implementation of the mathematical program of the Gas equations you plan to use (i.e. MINLPGasModel) and FooSolver is the JuMP optimizer you want to use to solve the optimization problem (i.e. IpoptSolver).
