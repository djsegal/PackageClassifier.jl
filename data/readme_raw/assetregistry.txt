AssetRegistry AssetRegistry allows you to serve arbitrary files and folders, using a global registry. Now packages like Mux and IJulia can look up this registry and serve these files while packages like WebIO and InteractBase can register assets to be served to implement web-based UIs. Usage You can register an asset with the package by doing: key = AssetRegistry . register ( " path/to/asset " ) This key is the unique URL where the asset can be accessed. For example: julia > key = AssetRegistry . register ( " /Users/ranjan/.julia/v0.6/Tachyons/assets/tachyons.min.css " ) " /assetserver/97a47bdda5bd9274ad1a9cd10a0337f3b033a790-tachyons.min.css "
