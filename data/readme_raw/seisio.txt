SeisIO.jl A minimalist, platform-agnostic package for univariate geophysical data. Installation | Documentation From the Julia prompt, type: ] add SeisIO ; (Backspace); using SeisIO Summary | Collaboration Designed for speed, efficiency, and ease of use. Includes web clients, readers for common seismic data formats, and fast file writers. Utility functions allow time synchronization, data merging, padding time gaps, and other basic data processing. Web clients: SeedLink, FDSN (dataselect, event, station), IRIS (TauP, timeseries) File formats: ASDF (r/w), Bottles, GeoCSV (slist, tspair), QuakeML (r/w), SAC (r/w), SEED (dataless, mini-SEED, resp), SEG Y (rev 0, rev 1, PASSCAL), SLIST, SUDS, StationXML (r/w), Win32, UW Getting Started Start the tutorials in your browser from the Julia prompt with cd(dirname(pathof(SeisIO))); include("../tutorial/install.jl") To run SeisIO package tests and download sample data, execute using Pkg, SeisIO; Pkg.test("SeisIO") Sample data downloaded for the tests can be found thereafter at cd(dirname(pathof(SeisIO))); sfdir = realpath("../test/SampleFiles/") Publications | Changelog | Issues Jones, J.P., Okubo, K., Clements.
