Introduction - Fread.jl This packages allows you to use R' {data.table} 's excellent fread function to read CSVs Use CSV.jl instead You should really be using CSV.jl because it performs quite well. I only use Fread.jl for converting data from parquet to feature etc now and not for reading CSVs as CSV.jl is actually really good. Installation using Pkg Pkg . add ( " https://github.com/xiaodaigh/Fread.jl " ) Install R packages You need to make sure you have {data.table} and {feather} installed in your R. E.g. in your R session install.packages(c( " data.table " , " feather " )) Usage To use the default parameters of fread using Fread a = fread (path_to_csv) To use customised parameters/arguments, you must set them by name using arg = e.g. using Fread a = fread (path_to_csv, sep = " | " , nrows = 50 ) Convert CSVs to feather or parquet You can use this package to convert CSVs to feather and parquet files using Fread csv_to_feather (path_to_csv, outpath) csv_to_parquent (path_to_csv, outpath) How does it work internally? The function fread does a few of things Reads the CSV using data.table::fread Saves the data.frame in feather format Loads the feather file into Julia as a DataFrame Step 2 creates a feather file which you can set the location of by using a 2nd unnamed argument .e.g. fread (path_to_csv, " path/to/out.feather " ) by default the feather output path is path_to_csv*".feather i.e. with the feather extension attached to the input file.
