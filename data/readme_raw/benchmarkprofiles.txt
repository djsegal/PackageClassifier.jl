BenchmarkProfiles A simple Julia package to plot performance and data profiles. This package contains Julia translations of original scripts by Elizabeth Dolan, Jorge Moré and Stefan Wild. See http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~wild/dfo/benchmarking . The original code was not accompanied by an open-source license. Jorge Moré and Stefan Wild have kindly provided their consent in writing to allow distribution of this Julia translation. See the consent folder for a full transcription. Watch out for the pitfalls of profiles! How to Install julia > Pkg . add ( " BenchmarkProfiles " ) Plotting is handled by Plots.jl so the user can choose among several available plotting backends. Example julia > using BenchmarkProfiles julia > T = 10 * rand ( 25 , 3 ); # 25 problems, 3 solvers julia > performance_profile (T, [ " Solver 1 " , " Solver 2 " , " Solver 3 " ], title = " Celebrity Deathmatch " ) References E.
