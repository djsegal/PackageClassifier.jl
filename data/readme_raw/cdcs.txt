CDCS CDCS.jl is an interface to the CDCS solver. It exports the cdcs function that is a thin wrapper on top of the cdcs MATLAB function and use it to define the CDCS.Optimizer object that implements the solver-independent MathOptInterface API. To use it with JuMP , simply do using JuMP using CDCS model = Model ( with_optimizer (CDCS . Optimizer)) To suppress output, do model = Model ( with_optimizer (CDCS . Optimizer, verbose = 0 )) Installation You can install CDCS.jl through the Julia package manager : ] add https : // github . com / blegat / CDCS . jl . git but you first need to make sure that you satisfy the requirements of the MATLAB.jl Julia package and that the CDCS software is installed in your MATLABâ„¢ installation.
