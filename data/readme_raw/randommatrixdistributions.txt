RandomMatrixDistributions A Julia package containing Distribution.jl -type specifications for various distributions arising from random matrix theory. Currently implemented distributions Matrix distributions SpikedWishart(beta, n, p, spikes) : Wishart distribution with spiked covariance (sampler for more than one spike implemented only for the real case. [1] spikes is an array [s1, ..., sr] such that the Wishart covariance is diagonal with entries 1 + s 1 , … 1 + s r , 1, …, 1 . Jacobi(beta, n1, n2, p) : Random matrices of the form E(E+H) -1 . Here E and H are (n 1 , p) and (n 2 , p) white Wisharts respectively. [2] Limiting eigenvalue distributions MarchenkoPastur(gamma) : Limiting empirical spectral density of a real white Wishart matrix with p/n → γ as long as 0 < γ < 1 . TracyWidom(beta) : Limiting distribution of the maximum eigenvalue of many random matrix ensembles with Dyson parameter beta. Wachter(gamma1, gamma2) : Limiting empirical spectral density of Σ 1 Σ 2 -1 . Here Σ 1 and Σ 2 are sample covariance matrices with n 1 /p → γ 1 and n 2 /p → γ 2 . Efficient samplers The function randeigvals efficiently samples from the distribution of eigenvalues of the implemented random matrix distributions. It does this by generating a tridiagonal or banded matrix with eigenvalue equal in distribution to the specified model. Examples An Jupyter notebook demonstrating all of the implemented eigenvalue samplers is provided in /examples/eigenvalue-simulation.ipynb .
