EffectiveWaves A Julia package for calculating, processing and plotting waves travelling in heterogeneous materials. The focus is on ensemble averaged waves. Documentation Build Status At present, the packages calculates effective wavenumbers, wave transimission and wave reflection from random particulate materials in two-dimensions, see arXiv preprint for details on the mathematics, or these notes for the formulas. Installation Type into Julia: using Pkg Pkg . clone ( " https://github.com/arturgower/EffectiveWaves.jl.git " ) using EffectiveWaves Documentation STABLE — documentation of the most recently tagged version. DEVEL — documentation of the in-development version. Simple example Effective wavenumbers for two species randomly (uniformly) distributed in Glycerol. # where: ρ = density, r = radius, c = wavespeed, and volfrac = volume fraction const WaterDistilled = Medium (ρ = 0.998 * 1000 , c = 1496.0 ) const Glycerol = Medium (ρ = 1.26 * 1000 , c = 1904.0 ) species = [ Specie (ρ = WaterDistilled . ρ,r = 30.e-6 , c = WaterDistilled . c, volfrac = 0.1 ), Specie (ρ = Inf , r = 100.0e-6 , c = 2.0 , volfrac = 0.2 ) ] # background medium background = Glycerol Calculate effective wavenumbers: # angular frequencies ωs = LinRange ( 0.01 , 1.0 , 60 ) * 30.0e6 wavenumbers = wavenumber_low_volfrac (ωs, background, species) speeds = ωs ./ real (wavenumbers) attenuations = imag (wavenumbers) For a list of possible materials go to src/materials.jl .
