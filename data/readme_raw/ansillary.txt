Ansillary A Julia package for interacting with ANSI terminals. All documentation is in the module itself, please see the documentation link above or (if you've already installed the package) run julia -e ' using Ansillary; display(@doc Ansillary); println() ' Future Work REPLectomy: The standard library REPL package is pretty heavyweight, and Ansillary only uses like two things from it ( raw! and TTYTerminal ) so removing it seems more sensible. It would also be nice if Ansillary could theoretically be used as the base for REPL rather than the other way around. Mouse support. A nicer API for style than printstyled .
