WaterModels.jl WaterModels.jl is a Julia/JuMP package for steady state water network optimization. It is designed to enable computational evaluation of historical and emerging water network formulations and algorithms using a common platform. The code is engineered to decouple problem specifications (e.g., water flow, optimal water flow, network expansion) from water network optimization formulations (e.g., mixed-integer linear, mixed-integer nonlinear). This decoupling enables the definition of a wide variety of water network optimization formulations and their comparison on common problem specifications. Core Problem Specifications Water Flow (wf) - obtain flows using substantial physical relaxations Constrained Water Flow (cwf) - obtain flows using more accurate physical constraints Optimal Water Flow (owf) - minimize the energy required for network operation Network Expansion (ne) - minimize the cost of expansion (or design) while satisfying demand Core Network Formulations CNLP - convex nonlinear program used for determining network flow rates MICP - relaxation-based mixed-integer convex program MILP - mixed-integer linear program using piecewise linear approximations MILP-R - relaxation-based mixed-integer linear program NCNLP - non-convex nonlinear program Documentation The package documentation includes a quick-start guide . Development Community-driven development and enhancement of WaterModels is welcomed and encouraged. Please feel free to fork this repository and share your contributions to the master branch with a pull request.
