SynthesisFilters SynthesisFilters.jl provides waveform generation filters for speech synthesis, especially from mel-generalized cepstrum. Note that this package is built on top of SPTK.jl . The package is designed to provide a Julia-like interface with a focus on speech waveform synthesis. A part of the core is re-writen in Julia language from Speech Signal Processing Toolkit (SPTK) . Features LMADF : Log magnitude approximation digital filter for synthesis from cepstrum MLSADF : Mel-log spectrum approximation digital filter for synthesis from mel-cepstrum MGLSADF : Mel generalized-log spectrum approximation digital filter for synthesis from mel-generalized cepstrum AllPoleDF : All-pole digital filter for synthesis from LPC AllPoleLatticeDF : All-pole lattice digital filter for synthesis from PARCOR LSPDF : LSP digital filter for synthesis from LSP Demonstration notebook Introduction notebook : a brief introduction to SynthesisFilters.jl.
