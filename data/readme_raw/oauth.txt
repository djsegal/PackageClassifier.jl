OAuth Linux: Codecov: Documentation: My interpretation of the OAuth 1.0 protocol, based on my reading of RFC5849 , the liboauth C library and factoring out the OAuth authentication code from Twitter.jl . At one point, this package relied on liboauth and was a wrapper of that library's functions built using Clang.jl ; however, as I cleaned up the auto-generated functions from Clang, I decided that it would be easier and cleaner to re-write the library in Julia rather than require liboauth. This is still a work-in-progress, but works as a replacement for the authentication in the Twitter.jl package, so it should be fairly complete in its implementation.
