SimradEK60.jl Introduction Based on SimradRaw.jl, this project reads and intepretes Simrad EK60 RAW files, extracting power and phase angle information and allowing calculation of volume backscatter, Sv. Example using SimradEK60 using SimradEK60TestData filename = EK60_SAMPLE ps = SimradEK60.load(filename) ps38 = [p for p in ps if p.frequency == 38000] Sv38 = Sv(ps38) # Volume backscatter al38 = alongshipangle(ps38) # Split beam angle at38 = athwartshipangle(ps38) _R = R(ps38) # Range / depth _t = filetime(ps38) # timestamps References Simrad EK60 Context sensitive on-line help MacLennan, David, and E.
