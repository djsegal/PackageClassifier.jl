RData.jl Read R data files (.rda, .RData) and optionally convert the contents into Julia equivalents. Can read any R data archive, although not all R types could be converted into Julia. For running R code from Julia see RCall.jl . Installation From Julia REPL: Pkg . add ( " RData " ) Compression formats R data files could be compressed by either Gzip (the default), Bzip2 or Xz methods. RData.jl supports Gzip -compressed files out-of-the-box. To read Bzip2 or Xz -compressed files CodecBzip2.jl or CodecXz.jl must be installed. For example, to load a file compressed by Bzip2 you must first install the required codec: Pkg . add ( " CodecBzip2 " ) Then ensure CodecBzip2 is loaded before calling RData.load : using RData import CodecBzip2 load ( ' some_bzip2_compressed.rda ' ) Usage To read R objects from "example.rda" file: using RData objs = load ( " path_to/example.rda " ) The result is a dictionary ( Dict{String, Any} ) of all R objects stored in "example.rda". If convert=true keyword option is specified, load() will try to automatically convert R objects into Julia equivalents: R object Julia object named vector, list DictoVec DictoVec allows indexing both by element index and by its name, just as R vectors and lists vector Vector{T} T is the appropriate Julia type. If R vector contains NA values, they are converted to missing , and the elements type of the resulting Vector is Union{T, Missing} . factor CategoricalArray CategoricalArrays.jl Date Dates.Date POSIXct date time ZonedDateTime TimeZones.jl data frame DataFrame DataFrames.jl If conversion to the Julia type is not supported (e.g. R closure or language expression), load() will return the internal RData representation of the object ( RSEXPREC subtype).
