Advanced Pattern Matching for Julia Features: Matching against almost any data type with a first-match policy Deep matching within data types and matrices Variable binding within matches For alternatives to Match , check out toivoh's PatternDispatch.jl for a more Julia-like function dispatch on patterns. Installation Use the Julia package manager. Within Julia, do: Pkg . add ( " Match " ) Usage The package provides one macro, @match , which can be used as: using Match @match item begin pattern1 => result1 pattern2, if cond end => result2 pattern3 || pattern4 => result3 _ => default_result end It is possible to supply variables inside pattern, which will be bound to corresponding values. See the documentation for examples of this and other features.
