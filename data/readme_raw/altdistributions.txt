AltDistributions This is a collection of some probability distributions I find useful, primarily for Bayesian estimation. Eventually, they should be considered for contributing to Distributions.jl , but currently they reside in this package because I am experimenting with the interface, I am experimenting with the implementation (making it friendly to automatic differentiation), not all functionality is implemented (eg only the logpdf ). When the name of distributions coincides with one in Distributions , it is prefixed with Alt , eg AltMvNormal . Bibliography Lewandowski, Daniel, Dorota Kurowicka, and Harry Joe.
