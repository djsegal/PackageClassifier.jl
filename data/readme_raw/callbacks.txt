Callbacks Documentation Build Status A library of of callbacks useful for monitoring/measuring simulations. This package is most useful in combination with Lens . The following example will update a UnicodePlot at every time step. using Callbacks, Lens struct Loop end function simulation () x = 0.0 while true y = sin (x) lens (Loop, (x = x, y = y)) x += rand () end end @leval Loop => plotscalar () simlulation () This may be a bit more frequent than what I need. Rather than update every time step, we can update every 1000000. @leval Loop => ( everyn ( 1000000 ) â†’ plotscalar ()) simulation ()
