Showoff Showoff provides an interface for consistently formatting an array of n things, e.g. numbers, dates, unitful values. It's used in Gadfly to label axes and keys. It defines a function called showoff that takes an AbstractArray of some type and returns an array of strings of the same length. If you want your type to look nice when plotted, just define a showoff function. Here's an example. using Showoff struct Percent value :: Float64 end function Showoff . showoff (xs :: AbstractArray{Percent} ) return [ string (x, " % " ) for x in showoff ([x . value for x in xs])] end Now we (and more importantly, Gadfly) can print percentages like: map (println, showoff ([ Percent ( 100 * rand ()) for _ in 1 : 20 ])) 60.505943% 73.255897% 97.477079% 43.330976% 69.023165% 52.580184% 13.011683% 22.718034% 93.843776% 29.875979% 64.110999% 91.203653% 91.534161% 80.684188% 81.674362% 11.530227% 30.498260% 38.876922% 35.444115% 8.857208% Notice, that compared to show , these all have the same number of digits trailing the . , and look nice when right-aligned. When no specialized showoff is defined, it falls back on the show function. This package was originally written by Daniel C. Jones .
