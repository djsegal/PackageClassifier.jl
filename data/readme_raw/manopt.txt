Manopt.jl Optimization on Manifolds. For a function f that maps from a Riemannian manifold ℳ onto the real line, we aim to solve Find the minimizer x on ℳ, i.e. the (or a) point where f attains its minimum. Manopt.jl provides a framework for optimization on manifolds. Based on Manopt and MVIRT , both implemented in Matlab, this toolbox aims to provide an easy access to optimization methods on manifolds for Julia , including example data and visualization methods. Getting started In Julia you can get started by just typing ] add Manopt then checkout the Getting Started: Optimize! tutorial or the examples in this repository, where you might want to adapt the resultsFolder string. You can also read the documentation .
