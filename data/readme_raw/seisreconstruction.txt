SeisReconstruction.jl This package contains Reconstruction tools for SeismicJulia project. At the moment, it is updated and tested against Julia v1. Installation To use this package you must first install the Julia programming language. Then, run the Julia application and type, at the prompt julia>using Pkg julia>Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/SeismicJulia/SeisReconstruction.jl.git")) julia>using SeisReconstruction If you use the SeismicJulia project, please cite the following paper @article{stanton2016efficient, title={Efficient geophysical research in Julia}, author={Stanton, Aaron and Sacchi, Mauricio D}, journal={CSEG GeoConvention 2016}, pages={1--3}, year={2016} } Basic usage For SeisPlot, please refer here . For SeisProcessing, please refer here . The following example produces the figure below. using SeisPlot,PyPlot, SeisReconstruction, SeisProcessing # Ray Abma and Nurul Kabir, 2006, 3D interpolation of irregular data with a POCS algorithm. # GEOPHYSICS, 71(6), E91-E97. # Gao, J., Stanton, A., Naghizadeh, M., Sacchi, M.D. and Chen, X., 2013, Convergence improvement # and noise attenuation considerations for beyond alias projection onto convex sets reconstruction. # Geophysical Prospecting, 61, 138-151. # Create linear events d = SeisLinearEvents (p1 = [ - .001 , 0.0015 ],tau = [ 1 , 1 / 3 ],dx1 = 5 ); # Randomly decimate, perc=80 means that 80% of the bins are empty deci = SeisDecimate (d;perc = 80 ); param = Dict ( :Niter => 100 , :fmax => 60 , :padt => 2 , :padx => 2 , :dt => 0.004 ) dpocs = SeisPOCS (deci;param ... ); subplot ( 121 ) SeisPlotTX (deci,cmap = " seismic " ,fignum = 1 ,pclip = 200 ,title = " Decimated data " ) subplot ( 122 ) SeisPlotTX (dpocs[:,:, 1 , 1 , 1 ],cmap = " seismic " ,fignum = 1 ,pclip = 200 ,title = " After POCS " ) For developers: contributing to the project New at GitHub?
