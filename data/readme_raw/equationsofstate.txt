EquationsOfState.jl This package implements some equations of state (EOS) of solids which are useful in research. It currently includes: Murnaghan EOS Birch–Murnaghan EOS family: BirchMurnaghan2nd BirchMurnaghan3rd BirchMurnaghan4th Vinet EOS Poirier–Tarantola EOS family: PoirierTarantola2nd PoirierTarantola3rd PoirierTarantola4th AntonSchmidt EOS (experimental) BreenanStacey EOS (experimental) The formulae are referenced from Ref. 1. This package also includes linear and nonlinear fitting methods, also referenced from Ref. 1. See its documentation . Compatibility Julia version: v1.0.0 and above Dependencies: see Project.toml deps field and compat field OS: macOS, Linux, and Windows TODOs Implement nonlinear fitting using CMPFit.jl .
