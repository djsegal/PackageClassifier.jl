IndentWrappers Usage indent(io, n) returns an ::IO object that writes n spaces after each \n . indent s can be chained, use in a functional way. It is recommended that implementations of Base.show using this package never close with a newline. Example: struct Foo contents end function Base . show (io :: IO , foo :: Foo ) print (io, " This is a Foo with the following contents: " ) let inner_io = indent (io, 4 ) for elt in foo . contents print (inner_io, ' \n ' , elt) end end end then julia > Foo ([ ' a ' , 42 , " string " ]) This is a Foo with the following contents : a 42 string Similar packages IOIndents.jl , which inspired part of the implementation
