SeDuMi SeDuMi.jl is an interface to the SeDuMi solver. It exports the sedumi function that is a thin wrapper on top of the sedumi MATLAB function and uses it to define the SeDuMi.Optimizer object that implements the solver-independent MathOptInterface API. To use it with JuMP , simply do using JuMP using SeDuMi model = Model ( with_optimizer (SeDuMi . Optimizer)) To suppress output, do model = Model ( with_optimizer (SeDuMi . Optimizer, fid = 0 )) Installation You can install SeDuMi.jl through the Julia package manager : ] add SeDuMi but you first need to make sure that you satisfy the requirements of the MATLAB.jl Julia package and that the SeDuMi software is installed in your MATLABâ„¢ installation.
