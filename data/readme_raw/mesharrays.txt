MeshArrays.jl MeshArrays.jl mainly defines an array type that can contain / organize / distribute collections of inter-connected arrays as done in climate models (see below & docs). It provides a simple but efficient and general solution to analyze and simulate climate system variables ( JuliaCon-2018 presentation ). Installation & Test using Pkg Pkg.add("MeshArrays") Pkg.test("MeshArrays") Use Examples The example below (1) generates a grid decomposition, (2) seeds random noise everywhere, (3) smoothes out the noise, and (4) plots the ( outer ) array of subdomain ( inner ) arrays. The diffusion-based smoother illustrates how MeshArrays.jl computes partial derivatives over the whole domain by transfering data between neighboring subdomains. using MeshArrays; p=dirname(pathof(MeshArrays)) GridVariables=GridOfOnes("PeriodicDomain",16,20) include(joinpath(p,"../examples/Demos.jl")) (in,out,_,_)=demo2(GridVariables); show(out) using Plots; plotlyjs() include(joinpath(p,"../examples/Plots.jl")) heatmap(out,clims=(-0.25,0.25)) Initial noise Smoothed noise Above, we used 16 subdomains , with 40x40 grid points each, covering a standard doubly periodic domain . However, MeshArrays also readily supports elaborate grids commonly used in climate models, such as the ones shown below. Jupyter Notebooks The JuliaCon-2018 presentation corresponds to two of the Jupyter notebooks found in the GlobalOceanNotebooks repo under DataStructures/ . Other notebooks in this repo demonstrate how MeshArrays can accurately compute planetary transports e.g. on the Arakawa C-grid commonly used in climate models, as well as Netcdf support for domain decompositions. The IndividualDisplacements.jl package (see its examples/ ) in turn computes trajectories of ocean plastic, plankton, etc over the C-grid configurations supported in MeshArrays.jl . Support for CF-compliant Netcdf input / output of MeshArray instances, with domain decomposition, and C-grid variables is provided via NCTiles.jl . Support for MITgcm use cases and specificities is provided via MITgcmTools.jl .
