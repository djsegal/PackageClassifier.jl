KissThreading.jl This package is WIP and not fully tested. Use with care ( tmap! should be safe to use). Simple patterns supporting working with threads in Julia. Functionalities: tmap! , tmapreduce functions. They are designed for relatively expensive mapping f ; trandjump and TRNG are for random number generators ready for threading getrange is a function returning a range of indices to traverse in a given thread it is designed for cases when we handcode loop inside @threads macro (usually when mapping f is cheap and e.g. can benefit from @simd ); see test/summation.jl for example usage Comparison of performance tmap! threading with copied random number generators and standard @Threading.threads . Tests run on 16 core AWS c4.4xlarge instance by running src/runtests.sh . We measure time using @time so tmap! has more of precompilation overhead reported. bootstrap.jl bubble.jl
