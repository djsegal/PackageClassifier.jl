EmpiricalRisks This Julia package provides a collection of predictors and loss functions, mainly to support the implementation of (regularized) empirical risk minimization methods. Test Status: Currently, the following higher-level packages are depending on EmpiricalRisks : Regression: solving moderate-size problem using conventional optimization techniques. SGDOptim: solving large-scale problem using stochastic gradient descent or its variants. Overview This package provides basic components for implementing regularized empirical risk minimization: Prediction models u = f(x; Î¸) linear prediction affine prediction multivariate linear prediction multivariate affine prediction Loss functions loss(u, y) squared loss absolute loss quantile loss huber loss hinge loss squared hinge loss smoothed hinge loss logistic loss sum squared loss (for multivariate prediction) multinomial logistic loss Notes: For each loss function, we provide methods to compute the loss value, the derivative/gradient, or both (at the same time). For each (consistent) combination of loss function and prediction model (which together are referred to as a risk model ), we provide methods to compute the total risk and the gradient w.r.t. the parameter. Regularizers squared L2 L1 elastic net (L1 + squared L2) Notes: For each regularizer, we provide methods to evaluate the regularization value, the gradient, and the proximal operator. Remarks: All functions in this package are carefully optimized and tested. Documentation Here is the Detailed Documentation .
