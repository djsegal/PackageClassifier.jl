SimilarityNetworkFusion This is an implementation of the Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) method ( Want et. al, Nature Methods 2014 ) in Julia. This is not an official implementation, as I'm not part of the authors of the paper. But, I followed the implementation provided by the authors in R and translated it to Julia.
