Shoco.jl Shoco.jl is a Julia package that provides access to the compression and decompression functions in the Shoco C library. The algorithms are optimized for short strings and perform well in comparison to smaz , gzip , and xz . Compression is performed using entropy encoding . Two functions are exported by this package: compress and decompress . Both accept a single AbstractString argument and return a String . It's important to note that the output from compress may not be valid UTF-8, which the String type doesn't care about, but your use case might. Here's an example using the functions at the REPL. julia > using Shoco julia > compress ( " what's happening " ) " ؉'s ⎨<g " julia > decompress ( " ؉'s ⎨<g " ) " what's happening " The Shoco C library does not work on Windows due to lack of C99 support, which means that this package has the same restriction.
