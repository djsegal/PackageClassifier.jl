PROPACK Travis, AppVeyor and Cirrus build statuses Coverage A Julia interface to PROPACK , a library for the computation of the truncated singular value decomposition of real (Float32, Float64) and complex (ComplexF32, ComplexF64) matrices or linear operators. PROPACK only requires operator-vector products to estimate singular values and singular vectors. How to Install julia > ] pkg > add PROPACK pkg > test PROPACK Examples Compute leading singular triplets U, s, V, bnd, nprod, ntprod = tsvd (A, k = 3 ) # 3 largest singular values and their singular vectors Compute leading singular values only s, bnd, nprod, ntprod = tsvdvals (A, k = 3 ) Compute smallest singular triplets Make sure A is square or short and wide to avoid the trailing zero singular values: U, s, V, bnd, nprod, ntprod = tsvd_irl (A, k = 2 ) Compute smallest singular values s, bnd, nprod, ntprod = tsvdvals_irl (A, k = 2 )
