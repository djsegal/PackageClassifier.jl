KrigingEstimators.jl This package provides high-performance implementations of Kriging estimators introduced by Matheron 1971 , and further developed by various geostatisticians. As the most general form of estimation with covariance/variogram models, Kriging does not require distributional assumptions, is well-defined in general Hilbert spaces, and is unbiased. These properties make Kriging a quite useful method for estimation with real world data. Currently, the following Kriging variants are implemented: Simple Kriging Ordinary Kriging Universal Kriging External Drift Kriging Installation Get the latest stable release with Julia's package manager: ] add KrigingEstimators Usage This package is part of the GeoStats.jl framework.
