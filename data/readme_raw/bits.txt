Bits This package implements functions to play with bits, of integers, and of floats to a certain extent. For example: julia > bits ( 0b110101011 ) < 00000001 10101011 > julia > ans[ 1 : 4 ] < 1011 > Currently, the following functions are exported: bit , bits , bitsize , low0 , low1 , mask , masked , scan0 , scan1 , tstbit , weight . They have a docstring, but no HTML documentation is available yet. In these functions, the right-most bit of a value has index 1 , but in some applications it's more natural for it to have index 0 . So the functions will likely be also implemented with indexes starting at 0 , and both alternatives will be available. It's possible that the default will be changed.
