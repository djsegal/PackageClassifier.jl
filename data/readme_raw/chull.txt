QHull A Julia wrapper around a PyCall wrapper around scipy.spatial.ConvexHull , which uses the qhull Convex Hull library. It implements the Polyhedral Computation library interface of Polyhedra.jl . The qhull library for computing the convex hull of data points seems to be the standard and very widely used. This module is a quick wrapper around a Python wrapper around the library, as suggested by Miles Lubin . Synopsis Low-level interface: using QHull p = rand ( 10 , 2 ) ch = chull (p) ch . points # original points ch . vertices # indices to line segments forming the convex hull ch . simplices # the simplexes forming the convex hull show (ch) Using Polyhedra.jl : using Polyhedra # Constructs a V-representation of 10 random points in 2 dimension v = vrep ( rand ( 10 , 2 )) using QHull # Constructs a polyhedon from this V-representation with the QHull library p = polyhedron (v, QHull . Library ()) # Removing redundant points, i.e. points which are in the interior of the convex hull removevredundancy! (p) # Show remaining points, i.e. the non-redundant ones @show vrep (p) # Show the H-representation, the facets describing the polytope @show hrep (p)
