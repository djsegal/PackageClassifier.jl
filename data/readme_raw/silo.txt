Silo.jl What is this repository for? Wrapper for the Silo file format (version 4.10.2) in Julia , generated using Clang.jl . Though I will continue to update this when I have time and interest, the very basic use case (in terms of high-level functionality) exemplified in the code and tests is typical for my needs. I welcome the extension of this package to the package's full generality on the high-level interface. Though it hasn't been extensively tested, the C-level wrappers output by Clang.jl should work fine for any "advanced" functionality you need from silo. v0.2.0 How do I get set up? For installation/building of the silo library, BinDeps.jl . package is required. To contribute, please make an issue or pull request. As a general guideline, modifications or additional low-level wrappers can be added to libsilo.jl. High-level wrappers go in the appropriate file(s). Who do I talk to?
