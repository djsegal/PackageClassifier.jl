Author Title Date Guilherme Gomes Haetinger KelvinletsImage.jl Nov. 8th, 2018 KelvinletsImage.jl Implementation for Kelvinlets Deformations presented on Regularized Kelvinlets: Sculpting Brushes based on Fundamental Solutions of Elasticity from Fernando De Goes and Doug L. James on Julia v1.0 . Deformations for the Grab , Scale and Pinch brushes. Including a Rectangle brush for the Grab function. Usage Initialization You must first initialize the structure KelvinletsObject to start deforming a given image. To do that you must first select an image end define a poisson ratio ν and an elastic shear modulus μ (both of them are explained on the above paper). using KelvinletsImage, TestImages ν = 0.4 μ = 1.0 image = testimages ( " mandrill " ) object = KelvinletsObject (image, ν, μ) After initializing the presented object, you will use ir for further operations. Grab Brush using KelvinletsImage pressurePosition = [ 256 , 256 ] forceVector = [ 200. , 0. ] ϵ = 70. # Brush Size grabbedImage = grab (object, pressurePosition, forceVector, ϵ) using KelvinletsImage frames = 20 grabbedImageGIF = makeVideo (object, grab, pressurePosition, forceVector, ϵ, frames) Scale Brush using KelvinletsImage pressurePosition = [ 256 , 256 ] scale = - 200000. # Negative value = inflates .. Positive Value = Contracts ϵ = 70. # Brush Size scaledImage = scale (object, pressurePosition, forceVector, ϵ) using KelvinletsImage frames = 20 grabbedImageGIF = makeVideo (object, scale, pressurePosition, scale, ϵ, frames) Pinch Brush using KelvinletsImage pressurePosition = [ 256 , 256 ] forceMatrix = [ 0. 0. ; 0. 300000. ] ϵ = 300. # Brush Size grabbedImage = pinch (object, pressurePosition, forceMatrix, ϵ) using KelvinletsImage frames = 20 grabbedImageGIF = makeVideo (object, pinch, pressurePosition, forceMatrix, ϵ, frames) Grab Rectangle Brush using KelvinletsImage pressureRectangle = [ 156 156 ; 256 256 ] forceVector = [ 150. , 150. ] ϵ = 50. # Brush Size grabbedImage = pinch (object, pressureRectangle, forceVector, ϵ) using KelvinletsImage frames = 20 grabbedImageGIF = makeVideo (object, grabRectangle, pressureRectangle, forceVector, ϵ, frames)
