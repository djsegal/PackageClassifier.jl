ImageMagick This package provides a wrapper around ImageMagick version 6. It was split off from Images.jl to make image I/O more modular. Installation Add the package with Pkg . add ( " ImageMagick " ) Usage ImageMagick will be used as needed if you've said using FileIO in your session or module. You should not generally say using ImageMagick . See FileIO for further details. It's worth pointing out that packages such as Images.jl load FileIO for you. Loading an image is then as simple as img = load (filename[; view = false ]) Set view=true to reduce memory consumption when loading large files, possibly at some slight cost in terms of performance of future operations. Advanced usage The environment variable MAGICK_THREAD_LIMIT can be used to throttle multithreading.
