Installation Pkg . add ( " SMTPClient " ) The libCurl native library must be available. It is usually installed with the base system in most Unix variants. Usage using SMTPClient opt = SendOptions ( isSSL = true , username = " you@gmail.com " , passwd = " yourgmailpassword " ) # Provide the message body as RFC5322 within an IO body = IOBuffer ( " Date: Fri, 18 Oct 2013 21:44:29 +0100 \n " * " From: You <you@gmail.com> \n " * " To: me@test.com \n " * " Subject: Julia Test \n " * " \n " * " Test Message \n " ) url = " smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465 " rcpt = [ " <me@test.com> " , " <foo@test.com> " ] from = " <you@gmail.com> " resp = send (url, rcpt, from, body, opt) Sending from file IOStream is supported: body = open ( " /path/to/mail " ) Gmail Notes Due to the security policy of Gmail, you need to "allow less secure apps into your account": https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps Function Reference send (url, to - addresses, from - address, message - body, options) Send an email. url should be of the form smtp://server:port or smtps://... . to-address is a vector of String . from-address is a String . All addresses must be enclosed in angle brackets. message-body must be a RFC5322 formatted message body provided via an IO . options is an object of type SendOptions . It contains authentication information, as well as the option of whether the server requires TLS. SendOptions (; isSSL = false , verbose = false , username = " " , passwd = " " ) Options are passed via the SendOptions constructor that takes keyword arguments.
