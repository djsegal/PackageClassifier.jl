DWARF Goal This package aims to provide a complete implementation of a decoder for the DWARF v4 (with v5 support added where already in common use and completely once release) debug information format as specified at dwarfstd.org . The APIs are designed to be usable at the REPL, even if doing so has a minor impact on achieveable performance. Nevertheless, the package should be performant enough to be used in debuggers, unwinders, etc. In particular, this package does not provide any higher level debugging functionality.
