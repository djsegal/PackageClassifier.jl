DistributionsAD.jl This package defines the necessary functions to enable automatic differentiation (AD) of the logpdf function from Distributions.jl using the packages Tracker.jl , Zygote.jl and ForwardDiff.jl . The goal of this package is to make the output of logpdf differentiable wrt all continuous parameters of a distribution as well as the random variable in the case of continuous distributions. AD of logpdf is fully supported and tested for the following distributions wrt all combinations of continuous variables (distribution parameters and/or the random variable) and using all defined distribution constructors: Univariate discrete Bernoulli BetaBinomial Binomial Categorical Geometric NegativeBinomial Poisson PoissonBinomial Skellam Univariate continuous Arcsine Beta BetaPrime Biweight Cauchy Chi Chisq Cosine Epanechnikov Erlang Exponential FDist Frechet Gamma GeneralizedExtremeValue GeneralizedPareto Gumbel InverseGamma InverseGaussian Kolmogorov Laplace Levy LocationScale Logistic LogitNormal LogNormal Normal NormalCanon NormalInverseGaussian Pareto PGeneralizedGaussian Rayleigh Semicircle SymTriangularDist TDist TriangularDist Triweight Uniform Weibull Multivariate continuous MvLogNormal MvNormal Matrix-variate continuous MatrixBeta Wishart InverseWishart Get Involved A number of distributions are still either broken or not fully supported for various reasons. See this issue . If you can fix any of the broken ones, a PR is welcome!
