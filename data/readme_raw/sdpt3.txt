SDPT3 SDPT3.jl is an interface to the SDPT3 solver. It exports the sdpt3 function that is a thin wrapper on top of the sdpt3 MATLAB function and use it to define the SDPT3.Optimizer object that implements the solver-independent MathOptInterface API. To use it with JuMP, simply do using JuMP using SDPT3 model = Model ( with_optimizer (SDPT3 . Optimizer)) To suppress output, do model = Model ( with_optimizer (SDPT3 . Optimizer, printlevel = 0 )) Installation You can install SDPT3.jl through the Julia package manager: ] add https : // github . com / JuliaOpt / SDPT3 . jl . git but you first need to make sure that you satisfy the requirements of the MATLAB.jl Julia package and that the SDPT3 software is installed in your MATLABâ„¢ installation.
