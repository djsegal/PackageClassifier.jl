CRISPulator Documentation PackageEvaluator Build Status A pooled genetic screen simulator Crispulator does not yet support Julia 1.0! We're still waiting on all the dependencies to be updated, please use Julia v0.6.4 in the mean time. Motivation Pooled screens are very useful, but they are also extraordinarily complex. This work aims to explore the importance of various screen parameters and the relevance of design choices on the downstream analysis and interpretation. Paper Nagy, T. & Kampmann, M.
