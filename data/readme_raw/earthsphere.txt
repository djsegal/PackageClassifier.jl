EarthSphere.jl A very simple Julia Library for measuring approximate distance and location given latitudes and longitudes #Usage: mylocation = Earth_LatLong_Coord(25,45,"SW") #I am located on earth, latitude 25 degrees south, longitude 45 west yourlocation = Earth_LatLong_Coord(65,10,"NE") #You are located on Earth, latitude 65 degrees north, longitude 10 degrees east distance = get_distance(mylocation,yourlocation) TODO: Refactor API, make names cleaner and clearer Allow choice of algorithm
