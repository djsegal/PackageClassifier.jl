Wells.jl (multi-well variable-rate pumping-test analysis tool) Wells.jl is a Julia code for multi-well variable-rate pumping test analysis based on analytical methods. Wells.jl computes drawdown in confined, unconfined and leaky aquifers through a variety of analytical solutions. Wells.jl considers fully or partially penetrating pumping and observation wells. It also includes wellbore storage capacity of pumping wells. Wells.jl can simulate variable-rate pumping tests where the variable rate is approximated either as piecewise linear or as step changes. It can also handle standard exponential and sinusoidal changes in pumping rates. Wells.jl utilizes the principle of superposition to account for transients in the pumping regime and to include multiple sources/sinks (e.g. pumping wells). Wells.jl combines the use of the principle of superposition and method of images to represent constant head or no flow boundaries. Wells.jl is a Mads module.
