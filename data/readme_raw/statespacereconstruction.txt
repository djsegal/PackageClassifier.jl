StateSpaceReconstruction.jl Julia package for state space reconstruction and partitioning. This package provides necessary functionality for the PerronFrobenius.jl , TransferEntropy.jl and CausalityTools.jl packages, which require fully flexible state space reconstructions, and partitioning tools for rectangular and simplex partitions. This package works seamlessly with Dataset instances from DynamicalSystems.jl , which also provide methods for state space reconstruction. See the CausalityTools documentation for more information.
