UnitfulIntegration This package enables integration of physical quantity-valued functions, using the Quantity types implemented in Unitful.jl . This package currently supports QuadGK.jl , which was originally in Julia Base. We do not support QuadGK as implemented in Julia 0.5. To use this package with Julia 0.5, you need to install the QuadGK package and qualify all invocations of QuadGK functions with the module name (e.g. import QuadGK; QuadGK.quadgk(...) ). PRs for other integration packages are welcome.
