Lexicon Please Note Documentation generation using Docile.jl and Lexicon.jl is being deprecated in Julia 0.4 and above in favour of Documenter.jl . Any questions about using this package? Ask them in the Gitter linked below: Documentation Builds Package Status Overview Lexicon is a Julia package documentation generator and viewer. It provides access to the documentation created by the @doc macro from Docile . Lexicon allows querying of package documentation from the Julia REPL and building standalone documentation that can be hosted on GitHub Pages or Read the Docs . Lexicon separates the non-essential parts from Docile so that package load times are not impacted when documenting packages using @doc . See this issue for details regarding the split. Installation Lexicon is available from METADATA and may be installed via: Pkg . add ( " Lexicon " ) Documentation Package documentation is available for the stable and development versions. Issues and Support Please file any issues or feature requests you might have through the GitHub issue tracker .
