HemirealNumbers A hemireal number z can be written z = r + mμ + nν where r , m , and n are real, and the special numbers μ , ν satisfy μ * μ = ν * ν = 0 , μ * ν = ν * μ = 1. Addition, subtraction, and any operation involving real numbers are defined "the obvious way," and the conjugate of z is just z . Multiplication of general hemireals is commutative but not associative. Hemireals with ν=0 are the same as dual numbers. The motivation for inventing/rediscovering (?) the hemireals was to solve, using finite numbers, what would otherwise be singular equations.
