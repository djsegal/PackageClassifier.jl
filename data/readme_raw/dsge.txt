New York Fed DSGE Model (Version 1002) The DSGE.jl package implements the New York Fed dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model and provides general code to estimate many user-specified DSGE models. The package is introduced in the Liberty Street Economics blog post The FRBNY DSGE Model Meets Julia . (We previously referred to our model as the "FRBNY DSGE Model.") This Julia-language implementation mirrors the MATLAB code included in the Liberty Street Economics blog post The FRBNY DSGE Model Forecast . Documentation for the most recent model version is available here . For the latest documentation on code , click on the docs|latest button above. The New York Fed DSGE team is currently extending the code to solve and estimate heterogeneous agent models. Filtering and smoothing algorithms are available in the registered package StateSpaceRoutines.jl . An implementation of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling, used for the estimation of DSGE models, can be found in the registered package SMC.jl . The foundational AbstractModel type, from which the AbstractDSGEModel type derives, is defined in the registered package ModelConstructors.jl . Further extensions of the DSGE model code may be released at the discretion of the New York Fed. Installation DSGE.jl is a registered Julia package in the General registry. To install it, open your Julia REPL, type ] to enter the package manager, and run pkg > add DSGE Versioning DSGE.jl is currently compatible with Julia v1.0 and v1.1 . To use DSGE.jl with Julia v0.7 , please check out tag 0.8.1 . To do this, click on the drop-down menu that reads branch:master on the left-hand side of the page. Select tags , then v0.8.1 . If you've already cloned the repo, you can simply run git checkout v0.8.1 . To use DSGE.jl with Julia v0.6 , please check out tag 0.4.1 . Disclaimer Copyright Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
