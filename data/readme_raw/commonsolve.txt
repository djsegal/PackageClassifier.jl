CommonSolve This holds the common solve command. The rules are that you must dispatch on one of your own types. That's it. No pirates. Oh and there're init and solve! as well. General recommendation solve function has the default definition solve (args ... ; kwargs ... ) = solve! ( init (args ... ; kwargs ... )) So, we recommend defining init ( :: ProblemType , args ... ; kwargs ... ) :: SolverType solve! ( :: SolverType ) :: SolutionType where ProblemType , SolverType , and SolutionType are the types defined in your package. To avoid method ambiguity, the first argument of solve , solve! , and init must be dispatched on the type defined in your package. For example, do not define a method such as init ( :: AbstractVector , :: AlgorithmType )
