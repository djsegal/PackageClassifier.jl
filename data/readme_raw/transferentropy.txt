TransferEntropy.jl Julia package for computing transfer entropy (TE), conditional mutual information (CMI) or any other information theoretic functional. This package provides essential algorithms for the CausalityTools.jl package, which provides methods to detect causal relationship from time series, and tools for computating the transfer operator and invariant measures from time series. See the CausalityTools.jl docs for more information.
