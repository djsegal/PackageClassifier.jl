NES.jl This is a simple NES emulator for the Julia programming language, based on the nes-py emulator. The emulator has been augmented to serve as a training environment for reinforcement learning experimentation and projects. Installation NOTE- NES.jl currently requires SCons and clang for building on Linux/macOS. So ensure that these dependencies are properly installed before you proceed with the actual install. Once you have installed the SCons and clang, open Julia REPL and enter the following commands julia > using Pkg julia > Pkg . add ( " NES " ) Demo NES.jl can currently render only in the plot pane of Juno IDE . Other methods will be added later. using NES environment_type = " smb " action_type = :RIGHT_ONLY output_mode = :color env = SMBEnv (environment_type, action_type, output_mode) current_state = reset!

The :tiles mode represents the game screen in a 13 x 16 Array whose elements can be one of four values. 0 - Empty space 1 - Hard surfaces, objects etc 2 - Enemies 3 - Mario For example, the following game screen in :color mode... is represented as following in :tiles mode 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Road Map NES Emulator Super Mario Bros and Super Mario Bros 2 environments Tetris environment Integrate with Gym.jl
