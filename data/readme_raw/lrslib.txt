LRSLib PackageEvaluator Build Status References to cite LRSLib.jl is a wrapper for lrs . This module can either be used in a "lower level" using the API of lrslib or using the higher level interface of Polyhedra.jl . As written in the user guide of lrs : A polyhedron can be described by a list of inequalities (H-representation) or as by a list of its vertices and extreme rays (V-representation). lrs is a C program that converts a H-representation of a polyhedron to its V-representation, and vice versa. These problems are known respectively at the vertex enumeration and convex hull problems. I have forked lrs to add a few functions to help doing the wrapper. These changes are not upstream yet so this version is used instead of the upstream version. Important notice : Windows is not supported yet.
