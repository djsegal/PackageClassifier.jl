HalideCall Halide is an promising project with an interesting design. I'm quite interested in seeing how some of their ideas work out when implemented in pure Julia, and preliminary experiments suggest that it may be possible to match the performance of Halide using pure Julia. The main purpose of this package, therefore, is for benchmark comparisons. But it's also possible that someday, chunks of Images will be written in Halide. We'll see.
