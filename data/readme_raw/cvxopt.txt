CVXOPT.jl â€” Julia interface to CVXOPT The package provides Julia wrappers for the following CVXOPT solvers: cvxopt.solvers.conelp cvxopt.solvers.coneqp cvxopt.solvers.lp cvxopt.solvers.qp cvxopt.solvers.socp cvxopt.solvers.sdp Installation and test (Linux/macOS) CVXOPT.jl requires PyCall to call functions from the CVXOPT Python extension from Julia. If you already have a Python executable in your path, then PyCall will use that version of Python. Alternatively, you can force PyCall to use Conda.jl to install a minimal Python distribution that is private to Julia by setting PYTHON="" : ENV[ " PYTHON " ] = " " # Optional: force PyCall to use Conda.jl Pkg . add ( " CVXOPT " ) Pkg . test ( " CVXOPT " ) This will automatically install CVXOPT from the conda-forge channel.
