GEEBRA.jl G eneral E stimating E quations with or without B ias- R educing A djustments (pronounced zeeÂ· bruh ) Package description GEEBRA is a Julia package that implements M-estimation for statistical models, either by solving estimating equations or by maximizing inference objectives, like likelihoods and composite likelihoods (see, Varin et al, 2011 , for a review), using only user-specified templates of the estimating function or the objective functions contributions. A key feature is the use of only those templates and forward mode automatic differentiation (as implemented in ForwardDiff ) to provide methods for reduced-bias M-estimation ( RBM-estimation ; see, Kosmidis & Lunardon, 2020 ). See the documentation for more information, and the examples for a showcase of the functionaly GEEBRA provides. See NEWS.md for changes, bug fixes and enhancements.
