LCA - Locally Competitive Algorithm This project is a bare bones implementation of LCA's sparse approximation algorithm. For more details see: Rozell, Christopher and Johnson, Don and Baraniuk, Richard and Olshausen, Bruno "Locally competitive algorithms for sparse approximation", IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2007 and subsequent papers on LCA.
