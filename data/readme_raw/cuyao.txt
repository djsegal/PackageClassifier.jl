Build status : CUDA support for Yao.jl . We are in an early-release beta. Expect some adventures and rough edges. Installation CuYao is a Julia Language package. It provides CUDA support for Yao.jl . To install CuYao, please open Julia's interactive session (known as REPL) and press ] key in the REPL to use the package mode, then type the following command For stable release pkg > add CuYao For current master pkg > add CuYao # master You don't need to install Yao if you have CuYao installed. They share the same API except CUDA backend. Documentation For documentation of Yao , please refer to documentation (stable) . CuYao.jl provides only two extra APIs, reg |> cu to upload a register to GPU, and cureg |> cpu to download a register to CPU. To start, see the following example using CuYao cureg = rand_state ( 9 ; nbatch = 1000 ) |> cu cureg |> put ( 9 , 2 => Z) measure! (cureg |> addbits! ( 1 ) |> focus! ( 4 , 1 , 3 )) cureg |> relax! ( 4 , 1 , 3 ) |> cpu Features Supported Gates general U(N) gate general U(1) gate better X, Y, Z gate better T, S gate SWAP gate better control gates BP diff blocks Supported Register Operations measure!, measure_reset!, measure_remove!, select addbit! insert_qubit! focus!, relax! join density_matrix Other Operations statistic functional diff blocks expect for statistic functional The Team This project is an effort of QuantumBFS, an open source organization for quantum science.
