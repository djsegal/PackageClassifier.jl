BaseTestDeprecated The Base.Test module changed substantially internally in Julia v0.5 . Most use cases are unaffected, but some features such as Test.with_handler were removed. This package provides the previous Base.Test functionality so that packages that depended on this functionality can keep working with a minimal change. Usage Replace using Base.Test with: if VERSION >= v " 0.5- " using BaseTestDeprecated const Test = BaseTestDeprecated else using Base . Test end
