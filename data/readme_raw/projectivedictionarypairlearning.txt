ProjectiveDictionaryPairLearning.jl previous DPL.jl Installation Pkg . add ( " ProjectiveDictionaryPairLearning " ) Demo using ProjectiveDictionaryPairLearning dpldemo () The output should be something similar to this The running time for DPL training is : 6.79 s The running time for DPL testing is : 0.23 s Recognition rate for DPL is : 97.579% Comparison with MATLAB version Actually the MATLAB version runs much faster as below. The running time for DPL training is : 3.12 s The running time for DPL testing is : 0.17 s Recognition rate for DPL is : 0.976 Usage Prepare Data and Labels Training Data TrData : Column Vectors (Should be normalize! d) Training Label TrLabel : Class Label Integers in A Row Testing Data TtData : Column Vectors (Should also be normalize! d ) Testing Label TtLabel : Class Label Integers in A Row Set Parameters DictSize = 30 τ = 0.05 λ = 0.003 γ = 0.0001 DPL Training DictMat, EncoderMat = TrainDPL (TrData, TrLabel, DictSize, τ, λ, γ) DPL Testing PredictLabel, Error, Distance = ClassificationDPL (TtData, DictMat, EncoderMat, DictSize) Ref: dpldemo() in ProjectiveDictionaryPairLearning.jl Advanced Usage Inner functions have been exposed to use. initialization.jl : DataMat, D, P, DataInvMat, A = initialization(Data, Label, DictSize, τ, λ, γ) updateA!.jl : updateA!(A, D, DataMat, P, τ, DictSize) updateD!.jl : updateD!(D, A, DataMat) updateP!.jl : updateP!(P, A, DataInvMat, DataMat, τ) Ref: TrainDPL.jl in ProjectiveDictionaryPairLearning.jl Dependencies MAT.jl PAPER The original matlab code is for the paper: Shuhang Gu, Lei Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo, and Xiangchu Feng, "Projective Dictionary Pair Learning for Pattern Classification," In NIPS 2014. From “dictionary learning” to “dictionary pair learning” ! The julia port of this code is for the paper: Qu, Xiaofeng; Zhang, David; Lu, Guangming; and Guo, Zhenhua, “Door knob hand recognition system,” Will appear in Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, IEEE Transactions on. Authors' Pages Lei Zhang's page Shuhang Gu's Page Downloads Download The Paper Download The Supplement Material Download The MATLAB Code DATASET The example feature dataset (YaleB_Jiang) used in this code is from Dr. Zhuolin Jiang: http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~zhuolin/projectlcksvd.html . For the experiments on AR and caltech 101 dataset, we also used the feature datasets provided by Dr. Jiang. For experiment on UCF50, we used the Action bank feature provided in: http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~jcorso/r/actionbank/ . Please refer to our paper for the detailed experimental setting.
