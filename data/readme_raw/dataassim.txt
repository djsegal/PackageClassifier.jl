DataAssim The packages implements various data assimilation methods: (Extended) Kalman Filter Incremental 4D-Var Ensemble Square Root Filter (EnSRF) Ensemble Square Root Filter with serial processing of the observations (serialEnSRF) Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (ETKF) Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (EAKF) Singular Evolutive Interpolated Kalman Ô¨Ålter (SEIK) Error-subspace Transform Kalman Filter (ESTKF) Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) The Julia code is ported from the Matlab/Octave code generated in the frame of the Sangoma project ( http://data-assimilation.net/ ). Example An example of using to package is available as a jupyter-notebook . Reference Most of the algorithms are described in the review article: Sanita Vetra-Carvalho, Peter Jan van Leeuwen, Lars Nerger, Alexander Barth, M.
