Crazyflie.jl This package provides a Julia interface for crazyflie-lib-python to communicate with a crazyflie . Installation Follow directions from crazyflie-lib-python to (system-wide) install the python library and any necessary dependencies. Then from the REPL julia > ] add Crazyflie Usage Scan for crazyflies julia > scan () Found 2 crazyflies : radio : // 0 / 60 / 2 M radio : // 0 / 80 / 2 M Run an algorithm The play function takes the crazyflie uri and the anonymous function in the do...end block as inputs: play (uri) do cf # send commands end It constructs the SyncCrazyflie python object, connects to the crazyflie, runs the provided algorithm, and disconnects from the crazyflie. A motor ramp test example: This is already included in the examples and can be invoked directly. function motor_ramp_test (uri) play (uri) do cf cf . commander . send_setpoint ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) thrust = 20000 for i = 1 : 20 cf . commander . send_setpoint ( 0 , 0 , 0 , thrust) thrust += i > 10 ? - 500 : 500 sleep ( 0.1 ) end cf . commander . send_setpoint ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) sleep ( 0.1 ) end end
