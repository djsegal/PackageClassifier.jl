Econometrics.jl This package uses continuous integration on Linux, OSX, and Windows (x64/x86). This package provides the functionality to estimate the following regression models: Continuous Response Models Ordinary Least Squares (Stata's reg / ivregress 2sls ) Longitudinal estimators Random effects model Ã  la Swamy Arora (Stata's xtreg / xtivreg ) Between estimator (Stata's xtreg, be ) Nominal Response Model Multinomial logistic (softmax) regression (Stata's mlogit ) Ordinal Response Model Proportional Odds Logistic Regression (Stata's ologit ) In addition, models incorporate the following features: Implements the StatsBase.jl StatisticalModel / RegressionModel API Support for frequency weights Robust Variance Covariance Estimators (e.g., heteroscedasticity consistent) Instrumental Variables Model through Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) Feature absorption for estimating a subset of parameters with high dimensional fixed effects as controls efficiently
