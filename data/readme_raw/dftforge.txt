DFTforge: the DFT postprocessing environment Simplify obtaining Hamiltonian, Eigenvalue, Eigenvector from DFT results, and Pre-caching them for parallelized calculations. Pre-cached results are easy to use when calculating in k and q space. DFTforge The wrapper for calculating Hamiltonian, Eigenvalue, Eigenvector from DFT results. read DFT results from OpenMX, Wannier90 Calculate Phi, Enk, Hks, Etc. functionalities K-point representation in INT (for unique K,Q). Gennerate K-points. Generalised argument parser (support TOML sytle input). Homepage & How to use
