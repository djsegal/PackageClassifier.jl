TexTables.jl The TexTables package provides an easy way for Julia users to quickly build well-formated and publication-ready ASCII and LaTeX tables from a variety of different data structures. It allows the user to easily build complex tables from small, modular components in an object oriented fashion, as well as providing some methods for easily constructing common tables from regression output. This package is still in beta. I'm quite happy with it and I've been using it (or some iteration of it) in my own work for quite a while. But I'd appreciate feedback, feature requests, or pull requests (if you want to help!). Quickstart TexTables is a registered Julia package, so it can be installed with the command Pkg . add ( " TexTables " ) For more usage details, please see the latest documentation.
