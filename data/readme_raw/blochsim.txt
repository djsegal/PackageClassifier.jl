BlochSim.jl This package provides functionality for simulating arbitrary MRI sequences. It includes support for (traditional) single-compartment Bloch simulations (using Spin objects) as well as multi-compartment Bloch-McConnell simulations (using SpinMC objects). Getting started This package is registered in the General registry, so you can install at the REPL with ] add BlochSim . Examples See the examples given in the documentation strings for how to use the provided functions. To access the documentation for, e.g., freeprecess , simply type ?freeprecess at the Julia REPL after loading the package. For examples of how to simulate full MRI sequences, see src/sequences.jl . Acknowledgement This package was developed based on Brian Hargreaves' Bloch simulation tutorial . All tests for this package of the form testX0x (like testA5b or testF3d ) are based on the corresponding section in the tutorial.
