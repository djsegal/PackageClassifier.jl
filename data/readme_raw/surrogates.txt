Surrogates.jl A surrogate model is an approximation method that mimics the behavior of a computationally expensive simulation. In more mathematical terms: suppose we are attempting to optimize a function f(p) , but each calculation of f is very expensive. It may be the case we need to solve a PDE for each point or use advanced numerical linear algebra machinery which is usually costly. The idea is then to develop a surrogate model g which approximates f by training on previous data collected from evaluations of f . The construction of a surrogate model can be seen as a three steps process: Sample selection Construction of the surrogate model Surrogate optimization ALL the currently available sampling methods: Grid Uniform Sobol Latin Hypercube Low Discrepancy Random ALL the currently available surrogate models: Kriging Radial Basis Function Linear Second Order Polynomial Support Vector Machines (SVM) Artificial Neural Networks Random Forests Lobachesky Inverse-distance ALL the currently available optimization methods: SRBF LCBS DYCORS EI Installing Surrogates package using Pkg Pkg . add ( " Surrogates " )
