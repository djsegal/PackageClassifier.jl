TikzQTrees.jl Plotting trees using TikzPictures.jl and the latex package tikz-qtree . Installation Install the latest version of this package by: (v0.7) pkg> add https://github.com/dharasim/TikzQTrees.jl#master TikzQTrees is build on top of TikzPictures.jl . If you can install TikzPictures, you should also be able to use TikzQTrees. Usage The package implements a wrapper type TikzQTree of tree data types which implement the functions value(tree) that returns the value of the root of the tree, and children(tree) that returns an iterator over the children of the root of the tree. It also provides SimpleTree , an example of a type that can be wrapped into TikzQTree : mutable struct SimpleTree{T} value :: T children :: Vector{SimpleTree{T}} end TikzQTrees are converted into TikzPictures to show them in the Juno plot pane and IJulia notebooks. In the REPL, the tex code of the tikz-qtree is printed. julia > using TikzQTrees, TikzPictures julia > tree = SimpleTree ( " root " , [ SimpleTree ( " left " ), SimpleTree ( " right " )]); julia > TikzQTree (tree) [ . root left right ] julia > save ( SVG ( " test_tree " ), TikzPicture ( TikzQTree (tree))) The saved plot is: One more thing This package additionally provides the macro @qtree for pretty printing of Julia's syntax trees: julia > qt = @qtree a * (b + c) == a * b + a * c [.{ == } [.{ * } {a} [.{ + } {b} {c} ] ] [.{ + } [.{ * } {a} {b} ] [.{ * } {a} {c} ] ] ] julia > save ( SVG ( " distributivity " ), TikzPicture (qt)) TreeView.jl is a related package that implements a macro @tree which is build on top of TikzGraphs.jl .
