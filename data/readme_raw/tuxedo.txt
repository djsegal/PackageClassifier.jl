Tuxedo.jl Dressing up your algorithms with documentation-driven development Implementing technical and scientific algorithms in code starts with a thorough understanding of the problem that is being solved and how a particular algorithm solves that problem. Tuxedo provides a framework for transforming theory found in publications and technical papers into documented, testable, and usable code. A proper and well-dressed algorithm implementation starts with naming it and documenting its purpose. Tuxedo provides a macro in the Julia environment that scaffolds documentation, function definition and unit tests. julia > @tux MyPackage mymethod
