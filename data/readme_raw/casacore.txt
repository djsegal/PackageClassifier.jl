CasaCore.jl CasaCore.jl is a Julia wrapper of CasaCore , which is a commonly used library in radio astronomy. Functionality is divided into two submodules: CasaCore.Tables for interfacing with tables (for example Casa measurement sets), and CasaCore.Measures for performing coordinate system conversions (for example calculating the azimuth and elevation of an astronomical target).
