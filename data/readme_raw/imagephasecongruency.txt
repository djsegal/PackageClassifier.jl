ImagePhaseCongruency Installation pkg> add ImagePhaseCongruency Summary This package provides a collection of image processing functions that exploit the importance of phase information in our perception of images. Local phase information, rather than local image gradients, is used as the fundamental building block for constructing feature detectors. The functions form two main groups: Functions that detect specific patterns of local phase for the purpose of feature detection. These include functions for the detection of edges, lines and corner features, and functions for detecting local symmetry. Functions that enhance an image in a way that does not corrupt the local phase so that our perception of important features are not disrupted. These include functions for dynamic range compression and for denoising. Documentation The main documentation page Examples Function reference
