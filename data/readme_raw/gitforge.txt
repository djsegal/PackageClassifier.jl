GitForge GitForge.jl is a unified interface for interacting with Git "forges" . julia > using GitForge, GitForge . GitHub julia > gh = GitHubAPI (); julia > result = get_user (gh, " christopher-dG " ); julia > isnothing (GitForge . exception (result)) true julia > GitForge . response (result) . status 200 julia > GitForge . value (result) . login " christopher-dG " API Coverage Eventually, the goal is to cover all the "basic" parts of services like GitHub, such as repositories, issues, pull requests, etc. However, this library was mostly motivated by development on Registrator , so at the moment most of the wrapped endpoints are just the ones needed for that specific task.
