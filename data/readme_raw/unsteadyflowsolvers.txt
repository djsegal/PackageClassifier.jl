This package (abbreviated UNSflow) is a library of low-order solvers for unsteady aerodynamics and aeroelasticity managed by Dr. Kiran Ramesh at the University of Glasgow. The solvers are written in Julia, are based on the discrete-vortex method and cater to various applications. This project is currently supported by EPSRC grant EP/R008035/1. Julia is a new high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing. Juliaâ€™s novel features are a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. Julia is fully open-source under the MIT license, and integrates mature, best-of-breed open source C and Fortran libraries for various computing algorithms. Installing Julia and UNSflow Download and install the latest stable version of Julia. At the prompt type, ]add UnsteadyFlowSolvers This will install UnsteadyFlowSolvers and dependent packages. Getting started Tutorials demonstrating the code with detailed READMEs are available in the UNSflowTutorials repository.
