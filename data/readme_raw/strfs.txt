StrFs Julia packages for strings with fixed maximum number of bytes. Overview StrF{S} <: AbstractString can be used for strings up to S bytes in UTF-8 encoding. When the string has less than that many bytes, it is terminated with a 0x00 . This mirrors the way Stata DTA files encode fixed length strings ( str# ), but other applications may also find this useful. StrF{S} strings are implemented by wrapping an SVector{S,UInt8} , with the potential efficiency gains that entails. Examples julia > using StrFs julia > gender = [ strf " male " , strf " female " ] 2 - element Array{StrF{ 6 }, 1 } : " male " " female " julia > gender[ 1 ] == " male " true julia > issorted (gender, rev = true ) true julia > motto = StrF {6} ( " ηβπ " ) # uses all bytes " ηβπ " julia > sizeof (motto) 6 julia > length (motto) 3 julia > motto == StrF {10} ( " ηβπ " ) # 0x00 at byte 7 true Related See StataDTAFiles.jl .
