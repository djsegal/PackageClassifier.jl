SliceMap.jl This package provides some mapslices -like functions, with gradients defined for Tracker and Zygote : mapcols (f, M) ≈ mapreduce (f, hcat, eachcol (M)) MapCols {d} (f, M) # where d=size(M,1), for SVector slices ThreadMapCols {d} (f, M) # using Threads.@threads maprows (f, M) ≈ mapslices (f, M, dims = 2 ) slicemap (f, A; dims) ≈ mapslices (f, A, dims = dims) # only Zygote The capitalised functions differ both in using StaticArrays slices, and using ForwardDiff for the gradient of each slice, instead of the same reverse-mode Tracker/Zygote. For small slices, this will often be much faster, with or without gradients. The package also defines Zygote gradients for the Slice/Align functions in JuliennedArrays , which is a good ways to roll-your-own mapslices -like thing.
