SoftPosit.jl Julia types for the C-based SoftPosit library - a posit arithmetic emulator. Posit numbers are an alternative to floating-point numbers. Posits extend floats by introducing regime bits, that allow for a higher precision around one, yet a wide dynamic range of representable numbers. For further information see https://posithub.org If this library doesn't support a desired functionality or for anything else, please raise an issue. 8, 16 and 32bit posit formats SoftPosit.jl emulates the following Posit number formats Posit(n,es) , with n number of bits including es exponent bits: Posit(8,0), Posit(16,1), Posit(32,2) as primitive types called Posit8, Posit16, Posit32 following the draft standard . Additionally, the following off-standard formats are defined as primitive types, which are internally stored as 32bit (the remaining bits are kept as zeros): Posit(8,1), Posit(8,2), Posit(16,1), Posit(16,2), Posit(24,1), and Posit(24,2) called Posit8_1 , Posit8_2 , Posit16_1 , Posit16_2 , Posit24_1 , and Posit24_2 . For all the types Posit8, Posit16, Posit32, Posit8_2, Posit16_2, Posit24_2 conversions between Integers and Floats and basic arithmetic operations + , - , * , / and sqrt (among others) are defined. Unfortunately, Posit8_1, Posit16_1, Posit24_1 are not yet fully supported by the underlying C library. To support quires, Quire8 , Quire16 and Quire32 are implemented as 32 / 128 / 512bit types for fused multiply-add and fused multiply-subtract. Additional math functions like exp , log , sin , cos , tan are defined via conversion to Float64 (no support yet of the C library) and therefore do not have error-free rounding. Examples Conversion to and from Float64 and computing a square root julia > using SoftPosit julia > p = Posit16 ( 16.0 ) Posit16 ( 0x7000 ) julia > sqrt (p) Posit16 ( 0x6000 ) julia > Float64 ( sqrt (p)) 4.0 for a comprehensive notebook covering (almost) all the functionality of SoftPosit.jl please read softposit_examples.ipynb Installation In the package manager do julia > ] add SoftPosit and then simply using SoftPosit which enables all of the functionality.
