TransformVariables Successor of ContinuousTransformations.jl . Features Simple interface. Fast implementation, unrolling when it makes sense. Targeted to applications in statistics, mainly ML , MAP , and Bayesian inference. Take advantage of Julia v0.7 features, especially named tuples and compiler optimizations. Caveat Work in progress. API will change rapidly, without warning. Expect speed regressions until API is finalized.
