PProf.jl Sometimes I need a hammer, sometimes I need a drill, this is a hammer-drill using Profile using PProf # collect a profile @profile peakflops () # Export pprof profile and open interactive profiling web interface. pprof () This prints a link to a local webserver where you can inspect the profile you've collected. It produces a file called profile.pb.gz in the pprof format, and then opens the pprof tool in interactive "web" mode. For more usage examples see the pprof docs: https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/doc/README.md Dependencies Graphviz In order to use pprof's web graph view (which is one of the best parts of pprof), you need to have graphviz installed. Click the above link to install. Usage help? > pprof pprof (data, period; web = true , webhost = " localhost " , webport = 57599 , out = " profile.pb.gz " , from_c = true , drop_frames = " " , keep_frames = " " ) Fetches and converts Profile data to the pprof format. help? > @pprof @pprof ex Profiles the expression using @profile and starts or restarts pprof. Calling pprof() or @pprof exports the profiling results to disk, and launches the web server in the background pointed at the results. Calling it again overwrites the results and refreshes the server, so you can reload the web-page to see your updated results. The link to the webserver is printed to your terminal, which you can then open in a browser. If you manually modify the output profile file, you can refresh the web server without overwriting the out file by calling PProf.refresh() .
