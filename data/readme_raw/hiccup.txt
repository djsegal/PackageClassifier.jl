Hiccup Pkg . add ( " Hiccup " ) Hiccup.jl is a super-simple library designed to make making HTML easy in Julia. It's heavily inspired by Clojure's Hiccup DSL. julia > using Hiccup julia > Hiccup . div ( " #foo.bar " , " hi " ) < div class = " bar " id = " foo " > hi < / div > HTML nodes are stored as the Node{T} type which renders itself smartly. julia > Node ( :img , " #id.class1.class2 " , Dict ( :src => " http://www.com " )) < img src = " http://www.com " id = " id " class = " class1 class2 " / > julia > tag (ans) :img A bunch of utility functions, with the names of tags, are provided which make this a bit more legible. You can import more with @tags : julia > @tags img, svg julia > svg ( " #id.class1.class2 " , Dict ( :src => " http://www.com " )) < svg class = " class1 class2 " src = " http://www.com " id = " id " >< / svg > And that's basically it.
