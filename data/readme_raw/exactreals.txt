ExactReals.jl This is a package for performing exact real arithmetic in Julia. The implementation uses a fast Cauchy sequence to approximate each real number. Installation To install the package, do julia > using Pkg julia > Pkg . add ( " https://github.com/dpsanders/ExactReals.jl " ) Usage Exact real numbers may be created from integers and rationals. Basic arithmetic ( + , - and * ) is implemented: julia > using ExactReals julia > ExactReal ( 3 ) ExactReal in 2.9999999999999996 .. 3.0000000000000004 julia > x = ExactReal ( 3 ) ExactReal in 2.9999999999999996 .. 3.0000000000000004 julia > y = ExactReal ( 3 // 5 ) ExactReal in 0.6 .. 0.6000000000000001 julia > x + y ExactReal in 3.5999999999999996 .. 3.6 julia > x - y ExactReal in 2.4 .. 2.4000000000000004 julia > x * y ExactReal in 1.7999999999999998 .. 1.8 See examples/logistic.jl for an example comparing exact real arithmetic to floating-point arithmetic.
