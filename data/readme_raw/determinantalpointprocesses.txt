DeterminantalPointProcesses.jl ! Disclaimer ! This package is based on the work of alshedivat/DeterminantalPointProcesses.jl and aims at keeping this package alive. An efficient implementation of Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) in Julia. Current features Exact sampling [1] from DPP and k-DPP (can be executed in parallel). MCMC sampling [2] from DPP and k-DPP (parallelization will be added). pmf and logpmf evaluation functions [1] for DPP and k-DPP. Planned features Exact sampling using dual representation [1]. Better integration with MCMC frameworks in Julia (such as Lora.jl ). Fitting DPP and k-DPP models to data [3, 4]. Reduced rank DPP and k-DPP. Kronecker Determinantal Point Processes [5]. Contributing Currently, no timeline, no milestones, no promisses. Contributions are sought (especially if you are an author of a related paper). Bug reports are welcome.
