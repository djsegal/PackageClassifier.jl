Winston: 2D Plotting for Julia Installation julia > Pkg . add ( " Winston " ) Getting started Winston offers an easy to use plot command to create figures without any fuss. After Winston is loaded by typing using Winston , the most basic plot can be created by just writing julia > plot (x, y) There is also an oplot command to add objects into already existing plots. To add something to this, use julia > oplot (x2, y2) And finally save it with julia > savefig ( " figure.png " ) # .eps, .pdf, & .svg are also supported More elaborate figures can be created by using the quick option for color, line, and symbols julia > plot (x, y, " r-- " ) This creates a red dashed curve. Abbreviations for colors and lines/symbols are same as in matplotlib. The plot command can also take more then one set of vectors and style options, like this julia > plot (x, y, " b: " , x2, y2, " g^ " ) which creates a blue dotted line and green triangles.
