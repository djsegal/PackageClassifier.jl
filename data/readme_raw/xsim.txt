XSim XSim is a fast and user-friendly tool to simulate sequence data and complicated pedigree structures Features An efficient CPOS algorithm Using founders that are characterized by real genome sequence data Complicated pedigree structures among descendants Quick-start # load XSim package using XSim # set genome information chrLength = 0.1 # length of each chromosome numChr = 2 # number of chromosomes nLoci = 10 # number of loci for each chromosome nQTL = 1 # number of QTL for each chromosomefects,mutRate); build_genome (numChr,chrLength,nLoci,nQTL) # this genome information will be used for subsequent computaions # generate founders popSizeFounder = 2 sires = sampleFounders (popSizeFounder); dams = sampleFounders (popSizeFounder); # random mating ngen,popSize = 5 , 10 sires1,dams1,gen1 = sampleRan (popSize, ngen, sires, dams); More homepage : QTL.rocks Installation : at the Julia REPL, Pkg.add("XSim") Documentation : available here Authors : Hao Cheng,Rohan Fernando,Dorian Garrick Citing XSim Cheng H, Garrick D, and Fernando R (2015) XSim: Simulation of descendants from ancestors with sequence data.
