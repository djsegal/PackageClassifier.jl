MetaImageFormat This package supports the MetaImage file format for the Julia language. You can read "*.mhd" files using using FileIO img = load ( " myimage.mhd " ) This package is a work-in-progress, and writing is not yet supported. This implementation was started by copying the NRRD package and was based purely on existing documentation on the MetaImage format. Documentation on the format's definition seems somewhat sparse (e.g., which fields are required and which are optional? In what order should they appear in the header? Are certain redundant combinations allowed and other disallowed? ...). In practice, the format appears to be largely defined by the IO capabilities of ITK and Fiji/ImageJ. In cases where there might be disagreements, one should check the source code of these other projects.
