RandomV06 This is a copy of random.jl from version 0.6 of Julia that has been adapted to run in Julia 0.7. The file was retrieved from https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/v0.6.4/base/random.jl , and hacked until it stopped producing errors or warnings in Julia 0.7. The motivation is the observation that at least some parts of the pseudorandom generator from Julia 0.7, and we sometimes want to reproduce tests and examples generated in Julia 0.6. Here are examples from Julia 0.6 and 0.7 that give different behavior: julia > VERSION v " 0.6.4 " julia > srand ( 1 ); rand ( 1 : 10 , 3 ) 3 - element Array{Int64, 1 } : 9 7 10 julia > VERSION v " 0.7.0-beta2.0 " julia > srand ( 1 ); rand ( 1 : 10 , 3 ) 3 - element Array{Int64, 1 } : 3 8 2 Installation (v0 .7 ) pkg > add https : // github . com / danspielman / RandomV06 . jl Using After obtaining the package, just type using RandomV06 . You can then access the old functions under this module, like this: julia > using RandomV06 julia > RandomV06 . srand ( 1 ); RandomV06 . rand ( 1 : 10 , 3 ) 3 - element Array{Int64, 1 } : 9 7 10 The module RandomV06 has its own version of GLOBAL_RNG , so it does not interact with the standard one: julia > srand ( 1 ); julia > RandomV06 . srand ( 1 ); julia > rand ( 1 : 10 , 3 ) 3 - element Array{Int64, 1 } : 3 8 2 julia > RandomV06 . rand ( 1 : 10 , 3 ) 3 - element Array{Int64, 1 } : 9 7 10 To facilitate writing code that can use either version, we have created variants of all of the functions in Random that have _ver appended. One can then select the version you want by calling one of these with one of the constants RandomV06.V06 , RandomV06.07 or RandomV06.Vcur as the first argument. julia > const Vcur = RandomV06 . Vcur; julia > const V6 = RandomV06 . V06; julia > srand_ver (V6, 1 ); julia > srand_ver (Vcur, 1 ); julia > rand_ver (V6, 1 : 10 , 3 ) 3 - element Array{Int64, 1 } : 9 7 10 julia > rand_ver (Vcur, 1 : 10 , 3 ) 3 - element Array{Int64, 1 } : 3 8 2 Bugs RandomV06 does not handle randjump .
