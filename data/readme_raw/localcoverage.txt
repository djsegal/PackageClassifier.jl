LocalCoverage This is a collection of trivial functions to facilitate generating and exploring test coverage information for Julia packages locally , without using any remote/cloud services. Installation This package is not (yet) registered. You need to install it with Pkg . clone ( " https://github.com/tpapp/LocalCoverage.jl.git " ) Generating HTML needs the genhtml utility, which is part of LCOV . On Debian/Ubuntu systems, use sudo apt install lcov Note that the code in this package assumes a reasonably recent lcov version when calling genhtml , ideally 1.13 , but 1.12 should work too. This only checked when building this package, and does not prevent installation, only emits a warning. See the discussion of issue #1 for a workaround. Usage using LocalCoverage generate_coverage (pkg) # generate coverage information open_coverage (pkg) # open in a browser clean_coverage (pkg) # cleanup
