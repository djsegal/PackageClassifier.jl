DBDSQLite.jl A Julia interface to the SQLite3 library that implements the DBI.jl protocol . Testing status: Package Documentation This package implements the interface described in the DBI.jl docs . Known Problems / Installation To function, this package needs to have access to a custom build of SQLite3 that has the SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA compile-time option enabled. The steps below describe one possible way to enable this option: Step 1 : Download a copy of the autoconf-ready source code for SQLite3 here . This package has been tested against sqlite-autoconf-3080300.tar.gz . Step 2 : Modify the first line of the sqlite3.c file to include the following code: // For use with DBI.jl, we always build SQLite3 with column metadata enabled #define SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA Step 3 : Compile and install the modified SQLite3 library: ./configure make make install On most systems that provide SQLite3, the SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA option is not enabled. Under these circumstances, most of the functionality of this library will work, except for the tableinfo and columninfo functions.
