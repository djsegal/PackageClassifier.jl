GeneticBitArrays.jl Minimal representations of DNA and RNA genetic sequences using BitArray s in Julia . Use Input using String , Vector{Char} with nucleotides indicated by their IUPAC code . You may also construct a sequence with a 4 x n BitArray - the same way sequences are represented internally with this package. Example julia> x = DNASeq("NVHMDRWABSYCKGT-") 16nt DNA sequence NVHMDRWABSYCKGT- julia> x.data 4Ã—16 BitArray{2}: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 Notes For a full featured package for biological sequences see BioSequences.jl .
