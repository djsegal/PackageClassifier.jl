CherenkovDeconvolution.jl Deconvolution estimates the probability density function of a latent quantity by relating this quantity to other, measurable quantities. It is frequently used in Cherenkov astronomy, where the energy distribution of cosmic particles is estimated from data taken by a telescope. Getting Started You can install this package with the Julia package manager (Julia-0.7 and above): ] add https : // github . com / mirkobunse / CherenkovDeconvolution . jl " ) The example directory provides you with some usage examples. More information is to be found on our website . Current Status CherenkovDeconvolution.jl implements our enhanced version of the Dortmund Spectrum Estimation Algorithm (DSEA+), the Regularized Unfolding (RUN) method, and the Iterative Bayesian Unfolding (IBU). An extensive set of experiments is taken out on these algorithms in another repository . We also ported this package to Python, calling it CherenkovDeconvolution.py .
