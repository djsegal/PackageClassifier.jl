MP3 MP3 is a Julia library for reading and writing MP3 files. Usage The API follows the idioms of FileIO , and uses SampleBuf type to store audio samples. This should supplement LibSndFile which does not support MP3 for patent issues.

An ID3v2 block will be added in front of the file, and the following tags can be optionally given as keyword arguments: title , artist , album , year , comment . julia > save ( " mono.mp3 " , audio; nchannels = 1 ) # save as mono audio julia > save ( " small.mp3 " , audio; bitrate = 128 ) # set bitrate to 128kbps julia > save ( " vbr.mp3 " , audio; VBR = true , quality = 0 ) # encode as highest-quality VBR julia > save ( " down.mp3 " , audio; samplerate = 8 kHz) # downsample to 8 kHz License This Julia library is distributed under MIT license. It uses LAME for encoding and mpg123 for decoding mp3, which are dynamically linked, binding to the terms of their LGPL.
