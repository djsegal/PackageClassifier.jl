AMA - Anderson Moore Algorithm Release verison : Build status : Installion To install AMA, use the package manager by typing: Pkg . add ( " AndersonMoore " ) Usage This algorithm solves linear rational expectations models. There is a fast and slightly faster method to execute the algorithm which is outlined below. AndersonMooreAlg calls a julia language implementation and callSparseAim executes a C/Fortran implementation. Lastly, gensysToAMA is a function for users who are accustomed to gensys style inputs and outputs but wish to use AMA. It can be shown that AMA is faster than gensys. To begin, Load the module: using AndersonMoore Declare the linear models to solve such as: h = [ 0. 0. 0. 0. - 1.1 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. ; 0. - 0.4 0. 0. 0. 1. - 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. ; 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. ; 0. 0. 0. - 1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. ] :: Array{Float64,2} Set number of equations: neq = 4 Set number of lags and leads: nlags = 1 nleads = 1 Set a tolerance to calculate numeric shift and reduced form: condn = 0.0000000001 Finally, give an inclusive upper bound for modulus of roots allowed in reduced form: upperbnd = 1 + condn To execute the algorithm with julia: (b, rts, ia, nexact, nnumeric, lgroots, AMAcode) = AndersonMooreAlg (h, neq, nlag, nlead, condn, upperbnd) Note - the above returns the tuple (b, rts, ia, nexact, nnumeric, lgroots, AMAcode) b - Reduced form coefficient matrix. rts - Roots returned by eig. ia - Dimension of companion matrix. nexact - Number of exact shift rights. nnumeric - Number of numeric shift rights. lgroots - Number of roots greater in modulus than upper bound. AMAcode - Return code. To execute the algorithm with C/Fortran: (h, b, q, AMAcode) = callSparseAim (h, nleads, nlags) Note - the above returns the tuple (h, b, q, AMAcode) h - The original h matrix after computations. b - Reduced form coefficient matrix. q - Asymptotic constraints. AMAcode - Return code. For those accustomed to gensys: (G1, CC, impact, fmat, fwt, ywt, gev, eu) = gensysToAMA (g0, g1, cc, psi, pi, div, varargin = " " ) To run AMA, subsitute the gensys style inputs into the above command but substitute "ama" for the argument varargin.
