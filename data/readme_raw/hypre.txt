Hypre.jl What is this repository for? Wrapper for the Hypre library in Julia , generated using Clang.jl . v0.0.0 How do I get set up? For installation/building of the hypre library, BinDeps.jl package is required. To contribute, please make an issue or pull request. As a general guideline, modifications or additional low-level wrappers can be added to libhypre.jl , and helpers can be added to libhypre_h.jl . High-level wrappers go in Hypre.jl . See also: corresponding openSUSE Build Service package for the cross-compiled windows library. Who do I talk to? Jonathan Goldfarb jgoldfar@my.fit.edu Roadmap [0.x.0] Low level wrapper usable to offer "direct" translation/access to the library Serial or MPI question settled, at least on Unix platforms Windows support [1.x.0] High level wrapper for creation of structured ( struct ), semi-structured ( sstruct ), unstructured FE ( FEI ) (cpp?), and linear-algebraic ( ij ) matrices, preconditioners Access to solution methods for defined matrices, including multigrid and other Krylov-based iterative methods implemented by Hypre
