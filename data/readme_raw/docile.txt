Docile Please Note Documentation generation using Docile.jl and Lexicon.jl is being deprecated in Julia 0.4 and above in favour of Documenter.jl . Any questions about using this package? Ask them in the Gitter linked below: Documentation Builds Package Status Overview Docile is a Julia package documentation system. It provides a macro, @doc , for documenting arbitrary Julia objects. This functionality is equivalent to the new @doc macro available from Base in Julia 0.4 . Additionally, Docile has support for using plain strings for documentation rather than using the @doc macro. See the package documentation for further details. Installation Docile supports both Julia 0.3 and 0.4 and can be installed via: Pkg . add ( " Docile " ) Viewing Documentation Package documentation is available for the stable and development versions.
