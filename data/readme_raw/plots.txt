Plots Created by Tom Breloff (@tbreloff) Maintained by the JuliaPlots members Plots is a plotting API and toolset. My goals with the package are: Powerful . Do more with less. Complex visualizations become easy. Intuitive . Stop reading so much documentation. Commands should "just work". Concise . Less code means fewer mistakes and more efficient development/analysis. Flexible . Produce your favorite plots from your favorite package, but quicker and simpler. Consistent . Don't commit to one graphics package, use the same code everywhere. Lightweight . Very few dependencies. Smart . Attempts to figure out what you want it to do... not just what you tell it.
