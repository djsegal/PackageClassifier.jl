PkgMirrors Use alternative mirrors to manage your packages for Julia. Linux, OSX: Windows: Code Coverage: 中文文档 PkgMirrors.jl is a client for boosting your download by using a mirror when you have a slow connection to GitHub (for example, in China). Current supported mirrors (see mirror_list.txt ): ZJU ( https://mirrors.zju.edu.cn/julia/ ) USTC ( https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/julia/ ) Installation NOTE: This package will only work with Pkg3, which means you need to run Julia 0.7+ to use it. The recommended way to install this package (starting from Julia v1.1): julia > # Type "]" to enter Pkg REPL-mode. # If you have a clean Julia environment, you can initialize the General registry (where you the packages are registered) by using: (v1 .1 ) pkg > registry add https : // mirrors . zju . edu . cn / julia / registries / General . git # Install this package from the mirror: (v1 .1 ) pkg > add https : // mirrors . zju . edu . cn / julia / PkgMirrors . jl . git # v1.3.0 The URL can be replaced by that of your preferred mirror. If you are using Julia 1.0 you need to use v1.1.0 at the end of the install command. Remove #v1.3.0 if you want to use the developing branch. If you prefer using scripts to initialize it, use the equivalent API functions like this: import Pkg Pkg . Registry . add (Pkg . RegistrySpec (url = " https://mirrors.zju.edu.cn/julia/registries/General.git " )) Pkg . add (Pkg . PackageSpec (url = " https://mirrors.zju.edu.cn/julia/PkgMirrors.jl.git " , rev = " v1.3.0 " )) import PkgMirrors PkgMirrors . setmirror ( " ZJU " ) Usage To start with PkgMirrors.jl , import the package and set a mirror for your Pkg . julia > import PkgMirrors julia > PkgMirrors . availables () # to list available mirrors. 2 - element Array{String, 1 } : " ZJU " " USTC " julia > PkgMirrors . setmirror ( " ZJU " ) # to set the mirror. [ Info : Updating mirror information ... [ Info : PkgMirror ZJU activated. PkgMirrors . PkgMirror ( " ZJU " , " https://mirrors.zju.edu.cn/julia " ) It will remember which mirror you have chosen, so there's no need to setmirror for the next time: julia > import PkgMirrors [ Info : Using saved mirror : ZJU (https : // mirrors . zju . edu . cn / julia) [ Info : Updating mirror information ... [ Info : PkgMirror ZJU activated. Once a mirror is selected and activated, you are free to use the standard Pkg to install or update packages. For example: julia > # Type "]" to enter Pkg REPL-mode. (v1 .0 ) pkg > update Updating registry at ` C: \U sers \s unoru \. julia \r egistries \G eneral ` Updating git - repo ` https://mirrors.zju.edu.cn/julia/registries/General.git ` Resolving package versions ...

If a package is not on the mirror it will have a fallback to use git clone from GitHub. When you exit Julia the changes to your registries will be undone automatically: julia > exit () [ Info : PkgMirror ZJU deactivated. You can also deactivate the mirror manually or clear the cache data by a simple statement: julia > PkgMirrors . deactivate () [ Info : PkgMirror ZJU deactivated. julia > PkgMirrors . clear () [ Info : Cache clear. New mirror? See julia-mirror for how to build a mirror. You can file an issue or open a pull request to add a new mirror into the mirror list . Issues Known: PkgMirrors.jl is not able to deal with packages not in General registry at the moment. It is not vital yet, since current working mirrors don't provide other registries as well. You are welcome to file an issue if having any questions. License MIT License
