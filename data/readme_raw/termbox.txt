Termbox What is this repository for? This is a wrapper for Termbox in Julia . v0.2.0 How do I get set up? The library requires BinDeps.jl , and (so far) a Unix-type build environment (tested on Ubuntu and OSX.) As of commit https://github.com/jgoldfar/Termbox.jl/commit/454d97586f689bcac8c50aab435e34deff61713d , this package supports v0.5+, but all subsequent commits only support released versions of Julia (v0.6+). Contributions welcome! To contribute, please make an issue or pull request. Who do I talk to? Jonathan Goldfarb jgoldfar@my.fit.edu
