Dark Integers Master branch: DarkIntegers.jl is a lightweight library for working with unsigned integers and polynomials. It includes: Modulo arithmetic for primitive types; Regular and modulo arithmetic for multi-limb (fixed size) unsigned integers; Arithmetic for cyclic and negacyclic polynomials, including Karatsuba multiplication and multiplication via NTT It is intended as a partial replacement for Nemo.jl , which requires compilation of C libraries, and is often slower (in particular, because DarkIntegers does not need C calls and heap allocations for operations with multi-limb integers). Note: the library currently does not provide constant-time guarantees for arithmetic operations.
