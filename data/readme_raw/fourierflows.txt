FourierFlows.jl Overview This software provides tools for partial differential equations on periodic domains using Fourier-based pseudospectral methods. A central intent of the software's design is also to provide a framework for writing new, fast solvers for new physical problems. The code is written in Julia . For more details refer to the documentation . Installation But it is simple: ] add FourierFlows and no more. Example(s) See the child package GeophysicalFlows.jl for example usage of FourierFlows.jl for problems in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics. Developers FourierFlows is currently being developed by Gregory L. Wagner (@glwagner) and Navid C. Constantinou (@navidcy). Cite The code is citable via zenodo . Please cite as: Navid C.
