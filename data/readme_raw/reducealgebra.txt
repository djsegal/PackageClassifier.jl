ReduceAlgebra.jl Meta-package for Reduce.jl and External Packages The upstream REDUCE software was originally created by Anthony C. Hearn (currently maintained on SourceForge ), the Julia packages included with this repository are based on the symbolic parser generator Reduce.jl created by Michael Reed, which extends the Julia language with REDUCE functionality. In Reduce.jl, an upstream REDUCE package can be used with load_package(::Symbol) . External packages provided by ReduceAlgebra.jl, Reduce.jl : core functionality (parser-generator) , upstream docs ( REDUCE / pdf ), Julia docs ( stable / latest ) ReduceLinAlg.jl : Linear algebra package , upstream docs ( LINALG / pdf ), Julia docs ( stable / latest ) What is included with the Reduce.jl core package? Julia docs ( stable / latest ) Integration of square roots , upstream docs ( ALGINT / pdf ) Package for compacting expressions , upstream docs ( COMPACT / pdf ) A package for finding limits , upstream docs ( LIMITS / pdf ) REDUCE LaTeX formula interface , upstream docs ( RLFI / pdf ), supports IJulia.jl output REDUCE source code optimization package , upstream docs ( SCOPE / pdf ) A package for series summation , upstream docs ( SUM / pdf ) More packages will be added.
