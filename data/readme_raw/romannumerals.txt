RomanNumerals.jl RomanNumerals.jl is a package that brings basic support for Roman numerals to Julia. Usage RomanNumerals introduces one new type called RomanNumeral . You can create new Roman numerals by calling RomanNumeral("MMXV") or RomanNumeral(2015). Alternatively, you can simply write rn"MMXV" and Julia will interpret it correctly. Basic arithmetic operations are supported. Examples julia > RomanNumeral ( 100 ) C julia > a = rn " lvi " LVI julia > b = rn " XXXX " XL julia > a + b, a % b (XCVI,XVI) julia > factor ( rn " XLVIII " ) Dict{RomanNumeral,RomanNumeral} with 2 entries : II => IV III => I julia > primes ( rn " X " ) 4 - element Array{RomanNumeral, 1 } : II III V VII Features A forgiving parser: Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored Can handle both lowercase and uppercase (and mixes of the two) Can interpret non-optimal numerals (e.g. XIIII ). Non-optimal numerals were valid in traditional Rome, and even used more commonly than their minimal counterparts. RomanNumerals.jl will automatically optimize non-optimal inputs. Can do number theory (Who knew the Romans were into this kind of thing) Fast Contributing Pull requests adding functionality are welcome (but please take note of the style guidelines)
