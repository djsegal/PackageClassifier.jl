TextParse TextParse uses Julia's generated functions to generate efficient specialized parsers for text files. Right now, there is a good set of features for reading CSV files (see the documentation ). Parsing packages can use TextParse as a framework for implementing parsers for other formats. Related packages CSV.jl - Package for reading CSV files into Tables API. It loads the data into a DataFrame . TextParse tries to be minimal and returns a tuple of vectors as the output of csvread and adds useful features such as parsing string columns as PooledArrays. CSVFiles.jl - Package for reading CSV via the FileIO.jl API into any IterableTables.jl sink. The package uses TextParse.jl for parsing.
