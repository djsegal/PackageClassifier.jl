LoopThrottle LoopThrottle is a tiny Julia package that exports the @throttle macro, which can be used to slow down a for loop or while loop by calling sleep at the beginning of each loop iteration (if necessary), so that a designated variable increases at a rate of at most max_rate (compared to wall time). Examples x = 0 @throttle t for t = 1 : 0.01 : 2 x += 1 end max_rate = 2. will finish in approximately 0.5 second. x = 0. @throttle x for i = 0 : 1000 x += 1e-3 end will use the default max_rate value of 1. and thus finish in approximately 1 second. i = 0 @throttle i while i <= 10 println (i) i += 1 end min_sleep_time = 1.5 max_rate = 1 will print the numbers from 0 to 10 at an average rate of one per second, while never sleeping for less than 1.5 second.
