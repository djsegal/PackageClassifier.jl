ComplexPhasePortrait.jl This package is a Julia implementation of the phase portrait ideas presented in Elias Wegert's book " Visual Complex Functions ". Installation From the Julia command prompt: Pkg . clone ( " git://github.com/JuliaHolomorphic/ComplexPhasePortrait.jl.git " ) Examples There is so far one exported function, portrait , and here I will try to detail its use. First we need function data over a grid. using ComplexPhasePortrait nx = 1000 x = range ( - 1 , stop = 1 , length = nx) Z = x ' .+ reverse (x) * im f = z -> (z - 0.5im ) ^ 2 * (z + 0.5 + 0.5im ) / z fz = f .(Z) Now a basic phase plot. img = portrait (fz) Now for a basic plot using NIST coloring . img = portrait (fz, ctype = " nist " ) Lines of constant phase are given by img = portrait (fz, PTstepphase) Lines of constant modulus are given by img = portrait (fz, PTstepmod) Finally, a conformal grid is given by img = portrait (fz, PTcgrid)
