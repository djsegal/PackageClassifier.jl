Navigation This package provides a number of navigation functions. The functions are based on the Aviation Formulary V1.46 of Ed Williams and the latlong scripts of Movable-type. Implemented Functions: distance bearing final_bearing midpoint intermediate_point destination_point intersection_point along_track_distance Vground head_wind cross_wind normalize Implemented Types: Point(ϕ, λ) Implemented constants: Rₑ Radius Earth in [m] The calculations are done using the Point struct for specifying points as radians All angles are radians, distances are in meters, and speeds are in m/s.
