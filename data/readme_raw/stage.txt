Stages This is a wrapper macro that supplies: simple name-based memoization/checkpointing (note: not @memoize) injected logger and ckpts arguments invocation of stage functions is asynchronous via @spawn results are returned as remote ref of tuple (result, logger-output) Scripts using stages would ideally run in something like an ijulia notebook. Currently, ijulia notebooks don't handle magics, but eventually, when they do, we can clean up/manage checkpoints via filesystem commands. Note: Ipython checkpoints provide script versioning but they don't checkpoint execution. News 11/1 -- Last 0.3 version tagged 11/1 -- Initial port to 0.4 passing 7/27 -- ported to 0.6
