FTD2XX.jl FTD2XX.jl is a thin wrapper for FTDI 's D2XX driver. ##Installation FTD2XX.jl is currently unregistered. It can be installed using Pkg.clone . Pkg . clone ( " https://github.com/cstook/FTD2XX.jl.git " ) The julia documentation section on installing unregistered packages provides more information. UART quick start The UART may be accessed as type IOftuart <: IO get information about devices device_infomation_list = ft_getdeviceinfolist () open a device. io = open ( FT_SerialNumber ( " FTXRNZUJ " ), 9600 , 8 , 1 , " n " ) # open by serial number or io = open ( FT_Description ( " C232HM-EDHSL-0 " ), 9600 , 8 , 1 , " n " ) # open by description or io = open ( FT_Location ( 0x000001a2 ), 9600 , 8 , 1 , " n " ) # open by location or io = open ( FT_DeviceIndex ( 0 ), 9600 , 8 , 1 , " n " ) # open by device index or uartconfig = UARTConfiguration ( 9600 , 8 , 1 , " n " , readtimeout = 1000 , # in milliseconds writetimeout = 1000 , # in milliseconds flowcontrol = " none " , # none, rts_cts, dtr_dsr, xon_xoff xon = 0x11 , xoff = 0x13 ) io = open ( FT_DeviceIndex ( 0 ),uartconfig) use all the normal IO functions write (io, 0x55 ) byteread = read (io, UInt8) close the device close (io) Documentation API for this wrapper FTDI website D2XX Programmer's Guide (from FTDI) ##OS Compatibility FTD2XX.jl is compatible with windows, linux, and osx. See FTDI's installation guides for instructions on installing drivers for your operating system. Drivers are assumed to be installed in the default locations. Additional Information for Linux To Do I2C as an array. SPI, JTAG as readdata = writeread(datatowrite)
