MatrixOptim.jl MILP, Robust Optim. and Stochastic Optim., and Decomposition Algorithm in Matrix (by Julia) MatrixOptim.jl is a package to model and solve optimization in uncertain context. The templates for robust optimization and stochastic optimization formulated in matrix are very coherent comprehensive, and the algorithms in matrix are very explicit. 1, Introduction The MILP can always be formulated in the following matrixes: min vec_c' * vec_x + vec_f' * vec_y s.t. mat_A * vec_x + mat_B * vec_y <= vec_b vec_x in R vec_y in Z 2, To Install and Test (v1.1) pkg> add MatrixOptim (v1.1) pkg> test MatrixOptim 3, How to Use For mixed integer linear programming: model = getModel (vec_c, mat_aa, vec_b) solveModel! (model) For mixed integer linear programming with Benders decomposition: model = getModelBenders (n_x, n_y, vec_min_y, vec_max_y, vec_c, vec_f, vec_b, mat_aa, mat_bb) solveModelBenders! (model) Right now, the supported solver is GLPK . I will add the feature to select other solvers, like Gurobi and CPLEX later. 4, Features Right now, the project is still in alpha stage. There are many new updates on JuMP , so the algorithms need to be updated. You can try to get the latest feature by the following line.
