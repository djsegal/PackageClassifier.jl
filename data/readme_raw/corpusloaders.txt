CorpusLoaders A collection of various means for loading various different corpora used in NLP. Common Structure For some corpus which we will say has type Corpus , it will have a constructior Corpus(path) where path argument is a path to the files describing it. That path will default to a predefined data dependency, if not provided. The data dependency will be downloaded the first time you call Corpus() . When the datadep resolves it will give full bibliograpghic details on the corpus etc. For more on that like configuration details, see DataDeps.jl . Each corpus has a function load(::Corpus) . This will return some iterator of data. It is often lazy, e.g. using a Channel , as many corpora are too large to fit in memory comfortably. It will often be an iterator of iterators of iterators ... Designed to be manipulated by using MultiResolutionIterators.jl . The corpus type is an indexer for using named levels with MultiResolutionInterators.jl. so lvls(Corpus, :para) works.
