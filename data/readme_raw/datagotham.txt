DataGotham.jl These IJulia notebooks provide the material used for the Julia tutorial at DataGotham 2013 . To follow along, you'll need to install all of the software we use along the way: Step 1 : Grab a binary of the latest Julia from http://julialang.org/downloads/#beta . If the binaries do not work, please install from source. The initial source installation takes a long time because of the dependencies that have to be installed, but subsequent builds takes less than a minute on average. Step 2 : For convenience, you can set up an alias to the newly installed Julia binary that you can use to invoke Julia from your normal shell prompt. On OS X, I use the following: alias julia="/Applications/Julia-*.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia" I also setup an alias for IJulia to make it easier to launch: alias ijulia="ipython notebook --profile=julia" Step 3 : To get all the packages we'll use, start a Julia REPL and then run the following commands in the Julia REPL: Pkg.add("Homebrew") Pkg.add("IJulia") Pkg.add("Gadfly") Pkg.add("RDatasets") Pkg.add("GLM") Pkg.add("Optim")
