Filetimes A trivial implementation of FILETIME style timestamps [1]. FILETIME was apparently introduced in the Windows NT operating system and is now used in a variety of file formats and equipment, including Simrad Echosounders. A FILETIME is an "integer value stating the number of 100 nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601". julia> d = DateTime(1969, 10, 8) 1969-10-08T00:00:00 julia> filetime(d) 116371296000000000 julia> datetime(ans) 1969-10-08T00:00:00 julia> filetime() 131546381807780000 julia> datetime(ans) 2017-11-08T18:09:40.778 References [1] FILETIME structure.
