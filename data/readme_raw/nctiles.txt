NCTiles.jl NCTiles.jl reads and writes NetCDF files that represent e.g. subdivisions of Earth's surface ( tiles ). Inter-operability with popular climate model grids and MeshArrays.jl and generation of CF-compliant files are key goals of this package. Notebooks/ See DataStructures/06_nctiles.ipynb in this GlobalOceanNotebooks repo Examples/ Several examples illustrate the package functionalities in detail (see examples/ex*.jl ) Background NCTiles.jl derives from the earlier nctiles implementation in gcmfaces ( Forget et al. 2015 ).
