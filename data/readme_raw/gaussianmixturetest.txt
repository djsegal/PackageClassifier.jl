GaussianMixtureTest Linux and macOS: Windows: This package implements the EM test for number of components of univariate Gaussian Mixture. The conventional log likelihood test can not be used to test the number of components because the Fisher regularity conditions are violated in Gaussian Mixture case [1]. This package follows the method of [3] but with no regression covariates. Note that the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is that of the maximum of C0 dependent $Chi^2(2)$ random variables which has no closed form when the null distribution has more than 1 component. However the p value can be obtained via simulation. In addition the typical EM algorithm may fail to give a consistent estimate of Gaussian Mixture parameters. This package still uses EM but add a penalty term on the log likelihood which ensures the consistency [2]. Usage To install this package, run Pkg.add("GaussianMixtureTest") The major functions are gmm , gmmrepeat , asymptoticdistribution and kstest . gmm estimates the parameters via EM algorithm. gmmrepeat repeat gmm for multiple starting values. asymptoticdistribution simulates the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic when the number of components is greater than 2. kstest conducts the Kasahara-Shimotsu test. See also the usage by running ?gmm Examples See the example code also in runtests.jl using Distributions using GaussianMixtureTest mu_true = [-2.0858,-1.4879] wi_true = [0.0828,0.9172] sigmas_true = [0.6735,0.2931] m = MixtureModel(map((u, v) -> Normal(u, v), mu_true, sigmas_true), wi_true) x = rand(m, 1000); asymptoticdistribution(x, wi_true, mu_true, sigmas_true, debuginfo=true); #Estimate the parameters with two components wi, mu, sigmas, ml = gmm(x, 2) #Do the KS test for C=2 v.s. C=3 kstest(x, 2) Acknowledgement Thanks Dr. Shimotsu and Dr. Kasahara for nicely providing their original R code and their detailed explanations.
