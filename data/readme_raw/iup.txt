Julia interface to the IUP GUI library GUI building, using the IUP library Installation Prior to using this library, you must install IUP on your computer. You will need both the IUP and the two subsidiary libs IM and CD . http://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/files/3.21/ http://sourceforge.net/projects/imtoolkit/files/ http://sourceforge.net/projects/canvasdraw/files/ To install IUP.jl , do Pkg.clone("IUP") Usage I have only tested it on Windows and recreated several of the IUP examples by porting directly from the C version. Those examples were created as modules so if you add the src and examples installation directory to LOAD_PATH , one can run them by typing (for example for the mathglsamples example): using mathglsamples_ mathglsamples()
