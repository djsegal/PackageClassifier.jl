RandomNumbers.jl Random number generators for the Julia language. Linux, OSX: Windows: Code Coverage: Documentation: RandomNumbers.jl is a package of Julia , in which several random number generators (RNGs) are provided. If you use the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), VSL.jl is also a good choice for random number generation. Installation This package is registered. The stable version of this package requires Julia 0.7+ . You can install it by: (v1 .1 ) pkg > add RandomNumbers It is recommended to run the test suites before using the package: (v1 .0 ) pkg > test RandomNumbers RNG Families There are four RNG families in this package: PCG : A new family of RNG, based on linear congruential generators , using a permuted function to produce much more random output. Mersenne Twister : The most widely used RNG, with long period. Random123 : A family of good-performance counter-based RNG. Xorshift : A class of RNG based on exclusive or and bit shift . Note that Random123 is now made a separate package as Random123.jl . You can still use your old code with RandomNumbers.Random123 as long as you import Random123 manually.
