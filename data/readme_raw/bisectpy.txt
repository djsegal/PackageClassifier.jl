BisectPy.jl This is a package that migrates Python's bisect module to Jula. Note that since Julia's array index starts from 1 but Python starts from 0 , the returned index of either bisect_left or bisect_right is always their Python's correspondence plus 1 ! Also, the behavior of Python's a[:i] where a is an array is also different from Julia: Julia array includes the i th item but Python does not!
