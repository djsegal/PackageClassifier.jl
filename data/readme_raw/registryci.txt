RegistryCI.jl RegistryCI provides continuous integration (CI) tools, including automated testing and automatic merging (automerge) of pull requests. The General registry uses RegistryCI. You can also use RegistryCI for your own Julia package registry. Automatic merging guidelines These guidelines are intended not as requirements for packages but as very conservative guidelines, which, if your new package or new version of a package meets them, it may be automatically merged. Note that commenting on a pull request will automatically disable automerging on that pull request. Therefore, if you want to leave a comment on a pull request but you still want that pull request to be automerged, please include the text [noblock] in your comment. New package Normal capitalization The package name should match r"^[A-Z]\w*[a-z][0-9]?$" , i.e. start with a capital letter, contain ASCII alphanumerics only, end in lowercase. Not too short At least five letters. You can register names shorter than this, but doing so requires someone to approve. Standard initial version number: one of 0.0.1 , 0.1.0 , 1.0.0 . Repo URL ends with /$name.jl.git where name is the package name. New version of an existing package Sequential version number If the last version was 1.2.3 then the next can be 1.2.4 , 1.3.0 or 2.0.0 . Compat entries for all dependencies. all [deps] should also have [compat] entries (and Julia itself) [compat] entries should have upper bounds Compat entries are not required for standard libraries. For the time being, compat entries are not required for JLL dependencies because they often have non-standard version numbering schemes; however, this may change in the future. Version can be installed Given the proposed changes to the registry, can we resolve and install the new version of the package? Version can be loaded Once it's been installed (and built?), can we load the code?
