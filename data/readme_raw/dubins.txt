Dubins.jl Release: Dev: Dubins.jl is a Julia package for computing the shortest path between two configurations for the Dubins' vehicle (see Dubins, 1957 ). The shortest path algorithm, implemented in this package, uses the algebraic solution approach in the paper " Classification of the Dubins set " by Andrei M. Shkel and Vladimir Lumelsky. All the unit tests and the data structures in this Julia implementation is borrowed from the C implementation and its corresponding python wrapper .
