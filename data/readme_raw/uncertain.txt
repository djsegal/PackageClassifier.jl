Uncertain.jl Handle error propogation in Julia NB: See Caveats below! Example Usage julia > load ( " uncertain.jl " ) julia > import Uncertain . UncertainNumber julia > a = UncertainNumber ( 1.0 , 0.1 ) UncertainNumber {Float64} ( 1.0 , 0.1 ) julia > b = UncertainNumber ( 2.0 , 0.2 ) UncertainNumber {Float64} ( 2.0 , 0.2 ) julia > 5 * a UncertainNumber {Float64} ( 5.0 , 0.5 ) julia > a * 2 UncertainNumber {Float64} ( 2.0 , 0.2 ) julia > a * b UncertainNumber {Float64} ( 2.0 , 0.28284271247461906 ) julia > cosh (a ^ 2 * b) UncertainNumber {Float64} ( 3.7621956910836314 , 1.2563812996702035 ) Caveats Currently, only basic arithmetic functions (+-*/) and trig/hypertrig functions are supported. Feel free to implement more and send a pull request. Correlations are currently ignored, so, e.g. a+a gives a smaller uncertainty than 2*a. The ^ operator is also currently incorrect. It looks like it is being induced from * instead of using the one defined in the module.
