MatrixMarket Package to read matrices from files in the Matrix Market native exchange format . The Matrix Market is a NIST repository of "test data for use in comparative studies of algorithms for numerical linear algebra, featuring nearly 500 sparse matrices from a variety of applications, as well as matrix generation tools and services." Over time, the Matrix Market's native exchange format has become one of the de facto standard file formats for exchanging matrix data. Usage using MatrixMarket M = MatrixMarket.mmread("myfile.mtx") M will be a sparse or dense matrix depending on whether the file contains a matrix in coordinate format or array format. The specific type of M may be Symmetric or Hermitian depending on the symmetry information contained in the file header. MatrixMarket.mmread("myfile.mtx", true) Returns raw data from the file header. Does not read in the actual matrix elements
