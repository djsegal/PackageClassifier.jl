FortanIO.jl Fortran binary (unformatted) file input/output for Julia. Example Assume we have some fortran code like the following that saves out data to data.bin . integer * 8 :: x( 100 ) real * 8 :: y( 100 ) ! ... code that calculates something in x and y ... open (unit = 9 , file = " data.bin " , form = " unformatted " ) write ( 9 ) x write ( 9 ) y close ( 9 ) This can be read into julia as follows: load ( " FortranIO " ) f = open ( " data.bin " ) x = FortranIO . read_record_array (f, Int64) y = FortranIO . read_record_array (f, Float64) close (f) An array of the appropriate size is returned by FortranIO.read_record_array . If, instead of two separate calls to write in the fortran code above, a single call had been used: write ( 9 ) x, y Then, the values can be loaded in julia using FortranIO . read_record (f, Array (Int64, 100 ), Array (Float64, 100 )) Values can also be written: f = open ( " file.bin " , " w " ) # Write a record containing one Int64 FortranIO . write_record (f, 10 ) # Write a second record containing several values of different types FortranIO . write_record (f, [ 1 , 2 , 3 ], int32 ( 4 ), 5.0 ) close (f) TODO Handle strings
