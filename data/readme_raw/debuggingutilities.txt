DebuggingUtilities This package contains simple utilities that may help debug julia code. Installation Install with pkg > dev https : // github . com / timholy / DebuggingUtilities . jl . git When you use it in packages, you should activate the project and add DebuggingUtilities as a dependency use project> dev DebuggingUtilities . Usage @showln @showln shows variable values and the line number at which the statement was executed. This can be useful when variables change value in the course of a single function. For example: using DebuggingUtilities function foo () x = 5 @showln x x = 7 @showln x nothing end might, when called ( foo() ), produce output like x = 5 (in foo at ./error.jl:26 at /tmp/showln_test.jl:5) x = 7 (in foo at ./error.jl:26 at /tmp/showln_test.jl:7) test_showline This is similar to include , except it displays progress. This can be useful in debugging long scripts that cause, e.g., segfaults. time_showline Also similar to include , but it also measures the execution time of each expression, and prints them in order of increasing duration.
