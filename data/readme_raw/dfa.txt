DFA.jl: Detrended fluctuation analysis in Julia ======= Introduction The DFA package provides tools to perform a detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and estimates the scaling exponent from the results. DFA is used to characterize long memory dependence in stochastic fractal time series. Install To install the package: julia> Pkg.clone("git@github.com:afternone/DFA.jl.git") Usage Examples We'll perform a DFA and estimates the scaling exponent for a random time series. using DFA x = rand(10000) n, Fn = dfa(x) You can also specify the following key arguments: order : the order of the polynomial fit. Default: 1 . overlap : the overlap of blocks in partitioning the time data expressed as a fraction in [ 0,1). A positive overlap will slow down the calculations slightly with the (possible) effect of generating less biased results. Default: 0 . boxmax : an integer denoting the maximum block size to use in partitioning the data. Default: div(length(x), 2) . boxmin : an integer denoting the minimum block size to use in partitioning the data. Default: 2*(order+1) . boxratio : the ratio of successive boxes. This argument is used as an input to the logScale function. Default: 2 . To perform a DFA on x with boxmax=1000, boxmin=4, boxratio=1.2, overlap=0.5: n1, Fn1 = dfa(x, boxmax=1000, boxmin=4, boxratio=1.2, overlap=0.5) To estimates the scaling exponent: intercept, α = polyfit(log10(n1), log10(Fn1)) # α is scaling exponent To plot F(n)~n: using PyPlot loglog(n1, Fn1, "o") To plot F(n)~n with fitted line: logn1 = log10(n1) plot(logn1, log10(Fn1), "o", logn1, α.*logn1.+intercept) References Peng C-K, Buldyrev SV, Havlin S, Simons M, Stanley HE, and Goldberger AL (1994), Mosaic organization of DNA nucleotides, Physical Review E, 49, 1685–1689.
