Spec.jl A package for expressing specifications. Usage Spec.jl is (very small) library for specfiying correctness properties of programs. Currently these serve both as functional tests (like asserts which can be disabled globally), or just a non-executable documentation. The long term goal is to replicate much of the functionality of Spec in clojure, as well as formal verification methods. function f () @pre x + y == 2 end Operations Preconditions are defined using @pre julia > f (x :: Real ) = ( @pre x > 0 ; sqrt (x) + 5 ) f (generic function with 1 method) julia > f ( - 3 ) ERROR : DomainError : Stacktrace : [ 1 ] f ( :: Int64 ) at ./ REPL[ 2 ] : 1 julia > @with_pre begin f ( - 3 ) end ERROR : ArgumentError : x > 0 Stacktrace :
