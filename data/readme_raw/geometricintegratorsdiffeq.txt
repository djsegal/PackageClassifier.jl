GeometricIntegratorsDiffEq.jl This package contains bindings for GeometricIntegrators.jl to allow it to be used with the JuliaDiffEq common interface. For more information on using the solvers from this package, see the DifferentialEquations.jl documentation . Common API Usage This library adds the common interface to GeometricIntegrators.jl's solvers. See the DifferentialEquations.jl documentation for details on the interface . Following the Lorenz example from the ODE tutorial , we can solve this using GIEuler via the following: using GeometricIntegratorsDiffEq function lorenz (du,u,p,t) du[ 1 ] = 10.0 (u[ 2 ] - u[ 1 ]) du[ 2 ] = u[ 1 ] * ( 28.0 - u[ 3 ]) - u[ 2 ] du[ 3 ] = u[ 1 ] * u[ 2 ] - ( 8 / 3 ) * u[ 3 ] end u0 = [ 1.0 ; 0.0 ; 0.0 ] tspan = ( 0.0 , 100.0 ) prob = ODEProblem (lorenz,u0,tspan) sol = solve (prob, GIEuler (),dt = 0.1 ) using Plots; plot (sol,vars = ( 1 , 2 , 3 )) The options available in solve are documented at the common solver options page .
