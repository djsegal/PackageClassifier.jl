DigitalCom.jl Purpose This package aims to provide some usefull tools to manipulate digital communication blocks in Julia. Currently, the package support the following elements Bit manipulation Generation of random binary sequence Conversion between binary sequences and octal sequences Modulation // demodulation Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) with 4-QAM (QPSK), 16-QAM, 64-QAM and 256-QAM. Hard demapper for the x-QAM formats Max log Soft demapper for the x-QAM formats Single carrier pulses shapes Raised Cosine pulse shape Square root raised Cosine pulse shape Multicarrier Waveform generation and decoding Support of multicarrier Waveforms: OFDM, UF-OFDM, WOLA, BF-OFDM Installation The package can be installed with the Julia package manager. From the Julia REPL, type ] to enter the Pkg REPL mode and run: pkg> add DigitalComm Or, equivalently, via the Pkg API: julia > import Pkg; Pkg . add ( " DigitalComm " ) Documentation STABLE â€” documentation of the most recently tagged version.
