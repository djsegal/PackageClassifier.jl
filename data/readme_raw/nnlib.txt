NNlib This package will provide a library of functions useful for ML, such as softmax, sigmoid, convolutions and pooling. It doesn't provide any other "high-level" functionality like layers or AD. Other packages can build on these functions as if they were defined in Base Julia; for example, CuArrays provides GPU kernels, and Flux provides automatic differentiation; both can work together without explicitly being aware of each other.
