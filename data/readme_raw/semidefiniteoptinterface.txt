SemidefiniteOptInterface (SDOI) Build Status This package make it easy to implement the API of MathOptInterface for semidefinite programming solver like CSDP , SDPA , DSDP and SDPLR that require the problem to be described in the following form: max ⟨C, X⟩ min ⟨b, y⟩ ⟨A_i, X⟩ = b_i ∑ A_i y_i ⪰ C X ⪰ 0 The well known SDPA file format uses this form but this package communicates to the solver directly and the solver wrappers use the C/C++ API without using a file.
