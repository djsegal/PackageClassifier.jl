FLAC.jl Julia bindings for libFLAC Usage Integration through FileIO makes loading and saving easy: data, fs = load ( " input.flac " ) data = data * 2 save ( " output.flac " , data, fs) save() can also take extra keyword parameters such as bits_per_sample and compression_level if such parameters are important. More advanced usage is possible through the use of the FLACDecoder API, which allows for, among other things, seeking within .flac streams and decoding segments of streams.
