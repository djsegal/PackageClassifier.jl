Bio-energetic food web model Simulations of biomass flows in food webs is a difficult task, yet performing it correctly is required to understand the ties betweeen the structure and function of ecological communities. This package provides a robustly tested, well-documented, computationally efficient common interface for the simulation of bio-energetic systems in food webs. This package is no longer compatible with Julia 0.6 (or older). Stable In development This is a julia implementation of the bioenergetic model applied to food webs.
