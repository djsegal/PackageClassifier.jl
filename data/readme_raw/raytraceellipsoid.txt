RayTraceEllipsoid This Julia package allows for geometric ray tracing with ellipsoids (actually domes shaped as ellipsoids). It includes intersection and refraction/reflection of rays with arbitrary ellipsoids. It accomplishes that in about 100 lines of code thanks to heavy use of CoordinateTransformations.jl and StaticArrays.jl . These ellipsoid-domes are defined with Ellipsoid (see details with help?> Ellipsoid ). The normal and refractive indices are defined within the Interface type. These two are baked into a single OpticUnit . Ray s advance! to intersect with the Ellipsoid s and bend! at the Interface s. The raytrace! function includes these two actions, taking in a Ray and an OpticUnit , updating the location and direction of the ray. Todo add rotated ellipsoids add more shapes, so it's not only RayTrace**Ellipsoid**
