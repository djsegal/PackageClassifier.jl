GPUArrays Reusable GPU array functionality for Julia's various GPU backends. Documentation Build Status This package is the counterpart of Julia's AbstractArray interface, but for GPU array types: It provides functionality and tooling to speed-up development of new GPU array types. This package is not intended for end users! Instead, you should use one of the packages that builds on GPUArrays.jl, such as CuArrays .
