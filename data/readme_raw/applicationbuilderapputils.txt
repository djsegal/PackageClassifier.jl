ApplicationBuilderAppUtils A small package providing utilities for applications built with ApplicationBuilder.jl . This is split out into a separate package so that users' application code does not need to have a dependency on the ApplicationBuilder module itself. Users should Pkg.add("ApplicationBuilderAppUtils") for their application's Project if they want to use these utilities.
