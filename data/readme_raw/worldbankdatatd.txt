Also, caching of country and indicator data is more aligned to the concepts used in EconDatasets . Installation : At the Julia REPL: Pkg.clone("https://github.com/JuliaFinMetriX/WorldBankDataTd.jl.git") Documentation : here . JuliaFinMetriX : here . JuliaFinMetriX standard library : here . Acknowledgements Most of the package originally has been developed by 4gh (Frank Herrmann) and can still be accessed through the official Julia package repository and on github .
