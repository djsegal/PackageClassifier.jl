Media Media.jl provides a display system which enables the user handle multiple input/output devices and decide what media types get displayed where. It's used by DevTools.jl and Juno. Set media types: using Media media (Gadfly . Plot, Media . Graphical) media (DataFrames . DataFrame, Media . Tabular) Hook media and concrete types up to outputs: setdisplay (Media . Graphical, BlinkDisplay . _display) which means "display graphical output on the BlinkDisplay device". You could also set tabular data (e.g. Matrices and DataFrames) to display with Blink.jl: setdisplay (Media . Tabular, BlinkDisplay . _display) rand ( 5 , 5 ) # > Displays in pop up window or set the display for specific types (abstract or concrete): setdisplay (FloatingPoint, BlinkDisplay . _display) 2.3 # > Displays with Blink In principle you can also set displays for a given input device, although this needs more support from Base to work well. Use unsetdisplay (Media . Tabular) to undo the change.
