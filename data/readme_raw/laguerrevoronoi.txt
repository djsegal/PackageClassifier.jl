LaguerreVoronoi Compute Laguerre-Voronoi diagrams in Julia Usage S = 10 * rand ( 10 , 2 ) # centers of 10 balls R = rand ( 1 : 5 , 10 ) # radii of 10 balls tri_list, V = LaguerreVoronoi . power_triangulation (S, R) voronoi_dict = LaguerreVoronoi . compute_voronoi_cells (S, V, tri_list) Output V: Array{Array{Float64, 1}, 1} containing the vertices of the power triangulation tri_list: Array{Any, 1} containing the triplets for each triangulation voronoi_dict: Dict{Int64,Array{Any,1}} Each entry of the dictionary is an array containing the cell borders. Each cell of that array is a tuple ((i, j), (v, d), s, t) representing a segment v + d * k , with s <= k <= t . The tuple (i, j) refers to the indices of the vertices in V that form that segment. nothing is used to indicate a point in the infinite or an infinite scalar, for rays.
