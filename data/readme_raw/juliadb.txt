JuliaDB is a package for working with large persistent data sets We recognized the need for an all-Julia, end-to-end tool that can Load multi-dimensional datasets quickly and incrementally. Index the data and perform filter, aggregate, sort and join operations. Save results and load them efficiently later. Use Julia's built-in parallelism to fully utilize any machine or cluster. We built JuliaDB to fill this void. Get Started Introduce yourself to JuliaDB's features at juliadb.org or jump into the documentation here !
