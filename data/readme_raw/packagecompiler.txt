PackageCompiler PackageCompiler is a Julia package with two main purposes: Creating custom sysimages for reduced latency when working locally with packages that has a high startup time. Creating "apps" which are a bundle of files including an executable that can be sent and run on other machines without Julia being installed on that machine. For installation and usage instructions, see the documentation .
