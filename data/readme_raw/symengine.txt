SymEngine.jl Julia Wrappers for SymEngine, a fast symbolic manipulation library, written in C++. Installation You can install SymEngine.jl by giving the following command. julia > Pkg . add ( " SymEngine " ) Quick Start Working with scalar variables Defining variables One can define variables in a few ways. The following three examples are equivalent. Defining two symbolic variables with the names a and b , and assigning them to julia variables with the same name. julia > a = symbols ( :a ); b = symbols ( :b ) b julia > a,b = symbols ( " a b " ) (a, b) julia > @vars a b (a, b) Simple expressions We are going to define an expression using the variables from earlier: julia > ex1 = a + 2 (b + 2 ) ^ 2 + 2 a + 3 (a + 1 ) 3 * a + 3 * ( 1 + a) + 2 * ( 2 + b) ^ 2 One can see that values are grouped, but no expansion is done. Working with vector and matrix variables Defining matricies of variables Some times one might want to define a matrix of variables. One can use a matrix comprehension, and string interpolation to create a matrix of variables. julia > W = [ symbols ( " W_ $i$j " ) for i in 1 : 3 , j in 1 : 4 ] 3 Ã— 4 Array{SymEngine . Basic, 2 } : W_11 W_12 W_13 W_14 W_21 W_22 W_23 W_24 W_31 W_32 W_33 W_34 Matrix-vector multiplication Now using the matrix we can perform matrix operations: julia > W * [ 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 ] 3 - element Array{SymEngine . Basic, 1 } : 1.0 * W_11 + 2.0 * W_12 + 3.0 * W_13 + 4.0 * W_14 1.0 * W_21 + 2.0 * W_22 + 3.0 * W_23 + 4.0 * W_24 1.0 * W_31 + 2.0 * W_32 + 3.0 * W_33 + 4.0 * W_34 Operations expand julia > expand (a + 2 (b + 2 ) ^ 2 + 2 a + 3 (a + 1 )) 11 + 6 * a + 8 * b + 2 * b ^ 2 subs Performs subsitution. julia > subs (a ^ 2 + (b - 2 ) ^ 2 , b => a) a ^ 2 + ( - 2 + a) ^ 2 julia > subs (a ^ 2 + (b - 2 ) ^ 2 , b => 2 ) a ^ 2 julia > subs (a ^ 2 + (b - 2 ) ^ 2 , a => 2 ) 4 + ( - 2 + b) ^ 2 julia > subs (a ^ 2 + (b - 2 ) ^ 2 , a ^ 2 => 2 ) 2 + ( - 2 + b) ^ 2 julia > subs (a ^ 2 + (b - 2 ) ^ 2 , a => 2 , b => 3 ) 5 diff Peforms differentiation julia > diff (a + 2 (b + 2 ) ^ 2 + 2 a + 3 (a + 1 ), b) 4 * ( 2 + b) License SymEngine.jl is licensed under MIT open source license.
