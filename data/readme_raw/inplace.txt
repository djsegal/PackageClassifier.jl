InPlace.jl - in-place operations where possible Build Status Test coverage Synopsis using InPlace a = big " 1 " b = a @inplace b += 2 a # is now also equal to 3 Description This package exposes a single macro, @inplace , which applies the operation in its expression argument in-place on the left-hand side (if it is mutable). Examples: @inplace a = f (args ... ) @inplace a += expr In the case where a is mutable, it is an implementation detail whether its value is actually modified. For this reason, one should use this operation only on values for which the current stackframe holds the only reference; e.g. by using deepcopy . In this version of the package, it is only the + , - (unary and binary) and * operations that are done in-place, and only for BigInt operands. References This package was created for speeding up PolynomialRings.jl .
