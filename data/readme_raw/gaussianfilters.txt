Testing Coverage Documentation GaussianFilters.jl GaussianFilters implements methods to define and run Kalman , Extended Kalman , Unscented Kalman , and Gaussian-Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density Filters on simulated data. It also implements simulation functions for the Kalman-class filters. Documentation The documentation for the package can be found here: https://sisl.github.io/GaussianFilters.jl/latest Installation GaussianFilters can be installed by running: using Pkg Pkg . add ( " GaussianFilters " ) Basic Usage Basic usage follows along defining appropriate models, constructing an appropriate filter, and running the filter with known actions on some measurement data. using GaussianFilters, LinearAlgebra # dynamics model A = [ 1 0.1 ; 0 1 ] B = [ 0 ; 1 ] W = [ 0.5 0 ; 0 0.5 ] dmodel = LinearDynamicsModel (A, B, W) # measurement model measure (x, u) = LinearAlgebra . norm (x, 2 ) V = [ 0.01 ] omodel = NonlinearObservationModel (measure, V) # filtering given some action and measurement ukf = UnscentedKalmanFilter (dmodel, omodel) b0 = GaussianBelief ([ 0 , 0 ], [ 1 0 ; 0 1 ]) b1 = update (ukf, b0, action, measurement) See documentation and examples for more details.
