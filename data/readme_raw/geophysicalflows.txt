GeophysicalFlows.jl This package leverages the FourierFlows.jl framework to provide modules for solving problems in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics on periodic domains using Fourier-based pseudospectral methods. Installation To install, do ] add GeophysicalFlows See examples/ for example scripts. Modules All modules provide solvers on two-dimensional domains. We currently provide TwoDTurb : the two-dimensional vorticity equation. BarotropicQG : the barotropic quasi-geostrophic equation, which generalizes TwoDTurb to cases with topography and Coriolis parameters of the form f = f₀ + βy . BarotropicQGQL : the quasi-linear barotropic quasi-geostrophic equation. MultilayerQG : a multi-layer quasi-geostrophic model over topography and with ability to impose a zonal flow U_n(y) in each layer. Cite The code is citable via zenodo . Please cite as: Navid C.
