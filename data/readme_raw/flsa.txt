FLSA Computing a graph induced Fused LASSO Signal Approximator . You can use it to denoise data. The package includes some utility methods to assess the algorithms and apply it to images as well es ion-mobilty spectrometry (IMS) data sets. Mathematical Formulation For the one dimensional version of the Johnson's dynamic programming algorithm, have a look into Lasso.jl Denoising The fused LASSO signal approximator can be used to denoise e.g. images: Noisy Input Cleaned by FLSA Algorithms Fast Gradient Projection (FGP) Also known as Fast Iterative Shrinkage Algorithm (FISTA). Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) Maximum Gap Tree (MGT) Own algorithm based on a iterative approximation by dynamic programming algorithm minimizing a sub-tree-graph. Example Image Graph using FLSA graph = FLSA . img_graph ( size (B) ... , dn = 2 , lam = 0.1 ) # (1) F = FLSA . fista (B, graph, verbose = true ; max_iter = 10 ) # (2) First you have to define graph (line (1) ). Then one of the algorithms above are called (see (2) ). HDF5 Input In order to be easily called from other languages a HDF5 intermediate data structure is supported that looks as follows (see generate_hdf5.py for a working python example): 1 2 3 ... n nodes/input /weight 1 2 3 ... m edges/head /tail /weight algorithm/@name /@param1 /@param2 Copyright Elias Kuthe 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018.
