sparseQFCA sparseQFCA is a registered package for the sparse Quantitative Flux Coupling Analysis . The example data files S.csv and rev.csv are extracted from the core E. coli model . Usage certificates, blocked, fctable = QFCA(S, rev) Inputs S : the associated sparse stoichiometric matrix rev : the boolean vector with trues corresponding to the reversible reactions Outputs certificates : the fictitious metabolites for the sparse positive certificates blocked : the boolean vector with trues corresponding to the blocked reactions fctable : the resulting flux coupling matrix Quick Start To get started, first run import Pkg; Pkg.add("sparseQFCA") to install the sparseQFCA package, and then see this Jupyter notebook for a demonstration on how to use it.
