ReadStat Overview ReadStat.jl: Read files from Stata, SPSS, and SAS The ReadStat.jl Julia package uses the ReadStat C library to parse binary and transport files from Stata, SPSS and SAS. All functions return a tuple, with the first element an array of columns and the second element a vector of column names. For integration with packages like DataFrames.jl you should use the StatFiles.jl package. Usage: using ReadStat read_dta ( " /path/to/something.dta " ) read_por ( " /path/to/something.por " ) read_sav ( " /path/to/something.sav " ) read_sas7bdat ( " /path/to/something.sas7bdat " ) Installation To install the package, run the following: Pkg . add ( " ReadStat " )
