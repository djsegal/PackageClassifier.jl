Yao Extensible, Efficient Quantum Algorithm Design for Humans. Introduction Yao is an open source framework that aims to empower quantum information research with software tools. It is designed with following in mind: quantum algorithm design; quantum software 2.0 ; quantum computation education. We are in an early-release beta. Expect some adventures and rough edges. Try your first Yao program A 3 line Quantum Fourier Transformation with Quantum Blocks : A (i, j) = control (i, j => shift ( 2 π / ( 1 << (i - j + 1 )))) B (n, k) = chain (n, j == k ? put (k => H) : A (j, k) for j in k : n) qft (n) = chain ( B (n, k) for k in 1 : n) Installation Yao is a Julia Language package. To install Yao, please open Julia's interactive session (known as REPL) and press ] key in the REPL to use the package mode, then type the following command For stable release pkg > add Yao For current master pkg > add Yao # master If you have problem to install the package, please file us an issue . For CUDA support, see CuYao.jl . Documentation Tutorial | Learning Yao by Examples Algorithm Zoo Some quantum algorithms are implemented with Yao in QuAlgorithmZoo . Online Documentation STABLE — most recently tagged version of the documentation. LATEST — in-development version of the documentation. Communication Github issues: Please feel free to ask questions and report bugs, feature request in issues Slack: you can join julia's slack channel and ask Yao related questions in #yao-dev channel. Julia discourse: You can also ask questions on julia discourse or the Chinese discourse Contribution Please read our contribution guide . The Team This project is an effort of QuantumBFS, an open source organization for quantum science. Yao is currently maintained by Xiu-Zhe (Roger) Luo and Jin-Guo Liu with contributions from open source community. All the contributors are listed in the contributors .
