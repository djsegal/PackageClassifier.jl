MortalityTables A Julia package for working with MortalityTables. Has first-class support for missing values. Examples Quickstart using MortalityTables tables = MortalityTables . tables () # loads the tables stored in the package folder vbt2001 = tables[ " 2001 VBT Residual Standard Select and Ultimate - Male Nonsmoker, ANB " ] # indexed by issue age and duration for select rate qx (vbt2001, 35 , 1 ) # .00036 # indexed by just attained age for ultimate rate qx (vbt2001, 95 ) # .24298 Example: Quickly access and compare tables using MortalityTables, Plots tables = MortalityTables . tables () cso_2001 = tables[ " 2001 CSO Super Preferred Select and Ultimate - Male Nonsmoker, ANB " ] cso_1980 = tables[ " 1980 CSO - Male Nonsmoker, ANB " ] age = 27 durations = 1 : 30 plot ( durations, [ qx (cso_2001,age,durations), qx (cso_1980,age,durations)], label = [ " 2001 CSO M SuperPref NS " " 1980 CSO M NS " ], title = " Comparison of 1980 and 2001 CSO \n for 27-year-old male " , xlabel = " duration " ) Usage Indexing The tables, by default, start at issue age zero and duration one and go to age 121. For values that are not defined in the table within that range, you will get a missing value. Index by issue age and duration to get select rates qx (vbt2001, 35 , 1 ) # .00036 qx (vbt2001, 35 , 61 ) # .24298 # can easily get ranges of values: qx (vbt2001, 35 , 1 : 30 ) # [0.0036, 0.0048, ...] Index by just age to get the ultimate rates qx (vbt2001, 95 ) # .24298 qx (vbt2001, 50 : 70 ) # [0.00319, 0.00345, ...] Other Usage Table Attributes ω(vbt2001) # 120 omega (vbt2001) # 120 Table MetaData When you have an expression that shows a Mortality table, it displays relevant information: tables = MortalityTables . tables () vbt2001 = tables[ " 2001 VBT Residual Standard Select and Ultimate - Male Nonsmoker, ANB " ] This shows the following in a notebook or REPL: MortalityTable: Name: 2001 VBT Residual Standard Select and Ultimate - Male Nonsmoker, ANB Provider: Society of Actuaries mort.SOA.org ID: 1118 mort.SOA.org link: https://mort.soa.org/ViewTable.aspx?&TableIdentity=1118 Description: 2001 Valuation Basic Table (VBT) Residual Standard Select and Ultimate Table - Male Nonsmoker. Basis: Age Nearest Birthday. Minimum Select Age: 0. Maximum Select Age: 99. Minimum Ultimate Age: 25.

If wanting select/ultimate rates, specify the `duration` and `age` should be the issue age. """ qx (table :: MortalityTable ,age) qx (table :: MortalityTable ,age,duration) """ `omega` (also `ω`) returns the last attained age which the table has defined (ie not including) `missing` """ omega (table :: MortalityTable ) ω(table :: MortalityTable ) Some Batteries Included Comes with some tables built in via mort.SOA.org and by using you agree to their terms . Not all tables have been tested that they work by default, though I have not encountered issues with any of the the VBT/CSO/other usual tables. Included: 2017 Loaded CSO 2015 VBT 2001 VBT 2001 CSO 1980 CSO 1980 CET Click here to see the full list of tables included. Adding more tables To add more tables for your use, download the .xml (aka the ( Xtbml format)[ https://mort.soa.org/About.aspx ]) version of the table from mort.SOA.org and place it in the directory the package is installed in. This is usually ~user/.julia/packages/MortalityTables/[changing hash value]/src/tables/ . Note: updating the package may remove your existing tables. Make a backup before updating your packages After placing packages in the folder above, restart Julia and the should be discoverable when you run mt.Tables() Todos Docs Automatically parse built-in tables Add more built-in tables Usage Examples More tests Performance testing Easy assumption overlay (e.g. scalars) References SOA Mortality Tables Actuarial Mathematics for Life Contingent Risks, 2nd ed Experience Study Calculations, SOA Similar Projects Pyliferisk, a Python package
