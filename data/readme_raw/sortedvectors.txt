SortedVectors A very lightweight Julia package to declare that a vector is sorted. Installation Type ] to enter pkg mode, and install with pkg > add SortedVectors How to use Standard constructor The only exported symbol is SortedVector . Use SortedVector ([lt = isless], xs) to sort xs and save the result in a vector. xs can be any <: AbstractVector . For immutable types (eg StaticArrays.SVector or UnitRange ), setindex! will not work. Special constructors for checking or skipping sorting If your code emits sorted vectors, use the SortedVector (SortedVectors . AssumeSorted (), lt, sorted_contents) constructor. This will skip checks. If your API accepts sorted vectors, and you want to check them, use the SortedVector (SortedVectors . CheckSorted (), lt, sorted_contents) constructor. In either case, you are responsible for ensuring that the argument vector is not modified later on. copy if you are unsure. Supported interfaces AbstractVector setindex! verifies that sorting is maintained.
