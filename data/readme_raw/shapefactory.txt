 About ShapeFactory library is intended to facilitate the usage of high-performance numerical methods in architecture and design. Based on IDispatch interface it removes all unnecessary features, such as support for multiple platforms, or creation of COM servers. Roughly speaking this library addresses specific CATIA platform, instead of trying to incorporate entire COM implementation. Compared to more general win32com libraries, this means better support for CATIA automation developers and ability to do breaking changes for the sake of better CATIA programming experience. Also, due to Julia transparent interaction with C or Fortran, all enterprise knowledge can be represented in clean and fast code, without annoying boilerplate or heavy and slow frameworks. Generative design field deals mainly with computational methods, this is somewhat different from software development, therefore it is better to use specialized platform full of sophisticated algorithms.

AddNewLinePtPt .(pts[ 1 : end - 1 ], pts[ 2 : end ]) As you can see, all constructors vectorized and entire library preserve object oriented paradigm of CATIA Automation API.
