Functional Julia Useful functions for functional programming in Julia. Based heavily on fogus/lemonad . I make no claims that all of these are Good Ideas. Some (or many) may be removed. See the tests for examples. Current exports: export # Basic functions partial, rpartial, not, complement, inc, dec, halve, explode, implode, truthy, falsey, ispos, isneg, iszero, # Sequence operations cons, construct, rest, butlast, drop, takewhile, dropwhile, partition, partitionall, mapcat, interpose, mapkeys, mapvals, interleave, repeat, repeatedly, cycle, splitat, # Combinators constantly, always, pipeline, comp, everypred, somepred, splat, unsplat, # Applicative functions update, remove, accessor, first, second, third, juxt, iterate, iterateuntil, reductions, # HOFs best, fnothing, curry2, curry3, curry4, gt, gte, lt, lte, eq, trampoline, Continue, @jump
