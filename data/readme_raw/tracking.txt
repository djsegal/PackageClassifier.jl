Tracking This implements a basic tracking functionality for GNSS signals. The correlation is done in the interval of PRNs. Each call of the tracking function returns the current code phase, Doppler, the Carrier-to-Noise-Density-Ratio (CN0), data bits, number of data bits and the last correlator output. Features Supports GPS L1 / L5 and Galileo E1B CN0 estimation Secondary code detection Bit detection Phased array tracking Getting started Install: julia > ] pkg > add Tracking Usage using Tracking using Tracking : Hz, GPSL1 carrier_doppler = 1000 Hz code_phase = 50 sample_frequency = 2.5e6 Hz prn = 1 state = TrackingState (GPSL1, carrier_doppler, code_phase) results = track (signal, state, prn, sample_frequency) next_results = track (next_signal, get_state (results), prn, sample_frequency) If you'd like to track several signals at once (e.g. in the case of phased antenna arrays), you will have to specify the optional parameter num_ants::NumAnts{N} and pass a beamforming function to the track function: state = TrackingState (GPSL1, carrier_doppler, code_phase, num_ants = NumAnts ( 4 )) # 4 antenna channels results = track (signal, state, prn, sample_frequency, post_corr_filter = x -> x[ 1 ]) # Post corr filter is optional
