StructIO Generates IO methods ( pack , unpack ) from structure definitions. Also defines packed_sizeof to give the on-disk size of a packed structure, which is smaller than sizeof would give, if the struct is marked as align_packed . Example usage julia > using StructIO julia > @io struct TwoUInt64s x :: UInt64 y :: UInt64 end julia > buf = IOBuffer ( collect ( UInt8 ( 1 ) : UInt8 ( 16 ))); julia > seekstart (buf); unpack (buf, TwoUInt64s) # Default endianness depends on machine TwoUInt64s ( 0x0807060504030201 , 0x100f0e0d0c0b0a09 ) julia > seekstart (buf); unpack (buf, TwoUInt64s, :BigEndian ) TwoUInt64s ( 0x0102030405060708 , 0x090a0b0c0d0e0f10 )
