FArrayMod.jl provides the ability to use arbitrary starting indices for arrays in Julia programming language. julia> using FArrayMod julia> y = FArray(Float64, -1:1, -7:7, -128:512, -5:5, -1:1, -3:3, -2:2, -1:1); julia> y[-1,-7,-128,-5,-1,-3,-2,-1] = 14 14 julia> y[-1,-7,-128,-5,-1,-3,-2,-1] += 5 19.0 The main purpose of this package is to simplify translation from Fortran codes intensively using Fortran arrays with negative and zero starting indices, such as the codes accompanying the book Numerical Solution of Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations by prof.
