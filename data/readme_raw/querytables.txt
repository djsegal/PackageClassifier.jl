QueryTables.jl Overview A simple read-only table type for the Queryverse . Installation You can install the package at the Pkg REPL-mode with: pkg > add QueryTables Getting started The main type in this package is DataTable , a data structure for tabular data. To create a new DataTable with a number of columns, just pass the columns as keyword arguments to the DataTable constructor: julia > dt = DataTable (Name = [ " John " , " Sally " , " Jim " ], Age = [ 23. , 43. , 56. ], Children = [ 2 , 0 , 3 ]) 3 x3 DataTable Name │ Age │ Children ──────┼──────┼───────── John │ 23.0 │ 2 Sally │ 43.0 │ 0 Jim │ 56.0 │ 3 To access an individual column by name, use the . dot syntax: julia > dt . Age 3 - element ReadOnlyArrays . ReadOnlyArray{Float64, 1 ,Array{Float64, 1 }} : 23.0 43.0 56.0 To access an individual row, use the normal julia index syntax: julia > dt[ 2 ] (Name = " Sally " , Age = 43.0 , Children = 0 ) If you want to access the value in an individual cell, it is generally more efficient to first access the column via the dot syntax, and then select the value for a given row via indexing: julia > dt . Name[ 2 ] " Sally " You can also create a new DataTable by passing any object to its constructor that implements the TableTraits.jl interface. That includes everything in the Queryverse , but also many other table types like DataFrames.jl , IndexedTables.jl etc. Every DataTable also implements the TableTraits.jl interface and can therefore be passed to any function that accepts a TableTraits.jl value. Alternatives QueryTables.jl is not the only julia initiative for tabular data, there are many other packages that have similar goals. Take a look at DataFrames.jl , IndexedTables.jl and TypedTables.jl (which in particular was a major inspiration for this package here). If I missed other packages, please let me know and I'll add them to this list! Getting help Please ask any usage question in the Data Domain on the julia Discourse forum .
