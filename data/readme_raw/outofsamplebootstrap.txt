OutOfSampleBootstraps.jl This is a Julia package that implements code for the paper "A simple block bootstrap for asymptotically normal out-of-sample test statistics." (Calhoun, in progress as of Jan. 2015.) The package does not yet offer even minimal functionality (i.e., it's not even at version 0.1) and I strongly discourage you from using it for any purpose other than, maybe, amusement. My plan is to get basic versions of different bootstraps for OOS forecast evaluation statistics working and then decide on future directions from there. Directory structure The directory structure is similar to that of most Julia packages: src/ contains source code for the estimators. test/ contains tests perf/ contains scripts that are useful for tracking changes in performance over time. The scripts should be run from outside the package because they may check out past versions of the package.
