Deldir deldir is an R package for computing Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi/Dirichlet tesselations. This Julia package wraps the Fortran code from deldir. Usage The coordinates of the generators are specified as two vectors that are fed to deldir , the main function of this package: x = rand ( 8 ) y = rand ( 8 ) del, vor, summ = deldir (x, y) The output from deldir are three DataFrames, one for the topology of the Delaunay triangulation, one for topology of the Voronoi tesselation and a summary mainly related to the area of the triangles and Voronoi cells. By default, deldir works with points in the unit rectangle, but other bounding rectangles can be specified as a third argument. The area of the Voronoi cells are also available directly with the function voronoiarea . Two functions are available to extract the edges of the Delaunay triangles and Voronoi cells in a "plot friendly" manner: Dx, Dy = edges (del) Vx, Vy = edges (vor) Using the results from above this can be plotted using e.g. the Plots package : using Plots scatter (x, y, xlim = ( 0 , 1 ), ylim = ( 0 , 1 ), markersize = 6 , label = " generators " ) plot! (Dx, Dy, label = " Delaunay " ) plot! (Vx, Vy, style = :dash , label = " Voronoi " ) One realization looks like the following. Installation Install the package by running ]add Deldir Motivation This is not the only Julia package for Delaunay/Voronoi computations. I am aware of the pure Julia implementation VoronoiDelaunay and the Boost wrapper Voronoi . However, Deldir has two qualities that I value: It interacts well with the bounding box. It returns the area of the Voronoi cells in the same order as the input generators . Update 2016-05-05 : I have made the pure Julia package VoronoiCells with similar functionalities that executes much faster. Consider the time taken to run the voronoiarea functions of both packages with an increasing number of points: The script generating this output is available in the examples folder.

I have e.g. chosen to ignore options regarding dummy points. Are you missing anything important? Check out the manual for the R package to see if the Fortran library supports it.
