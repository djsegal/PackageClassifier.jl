FCA.jl FCA.jl is a package for julia implementing free component analysis , which separates freely-independent random matrices out of their additive mixture. Installation The package has not been registered in METADATA.jl and can be installed with Pkg.clone . julia > Pkg . clone ( " https://github.com/lingluanwh/FCA.jl " ) Example A typical example of the usage of fca.jl is # separate freely independent rectangular random matrices out of their additive mixture using FCA, LinearAlgebra # generate freely two freely independent rectangular random matrices X1 and X2 N, M = 300 , 500 X1 = randn (N, M) / sqrt (M) U, V = Matrix ( qr ( randn (N,N)) . Q), Matrix ( qr ( randn (M,M)) . Q) D = [ Diagonal (( collect ( range ( 1 ,stop = 0 ,length = N)) .- 1 ) .^ 4 ) zeros (N, M - N)] X2 = U * D * V ' X = [X1, X2]; # mix X1, X2 linearly A = randn ( 2 , 2 ) # mixing matrix Z = A * X # use freecf to recover mixing matrix and free components (up to permutation and rescaling) Aest, Xest = freecf (Z; mat = " rec " ) # "rec" tells the function that we are dealing with the rectangular matrices # Aest recover A upto column permutation and column rescaling. @show pinv (Aest) * A # their product should approximate a diagonal matrix License This package is provided as is under the MIT License.
