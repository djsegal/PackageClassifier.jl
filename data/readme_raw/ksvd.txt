KSVD.jl K-SVD is an algorithm for creating overcomplete dictionaries for sparse representations. This package implements: K-SVD as described in the original paper: K-SVD: An Algorithm for Designing Overcomplete Dictionaries for Sparse Representation Matching Pursuit for representing signals using a given dictionary. Installation Launch Julia and type Pkg . add ( " KSVD " ) Usage Assume that each column of Y represents a feature vector (or an input signal from some system). D is a dictionary. Each column of D represents an atom. K-SVD derives D and X such that DX â‰ˆ Y from only Y. D, X = ksvd ( Y, 256 , # the number of atoms in D max_iter = 200 , # max iterations of K-SVD max_iter_mp = 40 , # max iterations of matching pursuit called in K-SVD sparsity_allowance = 0.96 # stop iteration when more than 96% of elements in X become zeros ) Matching Pursuit derives X from D and Y such that DX = Y in constraint that X be as sparse as possible. X_sparse = matching_pursuit (Y, D, max_iter = 200 ) Example Samples of the digits dataset in scikit-learn and the obtained dictionary of 256 atoms. See examples for more details. Provided functions Only a few functions are provided: ksvd and matching_pursuit . See the documentation .
