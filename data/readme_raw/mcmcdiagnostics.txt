MCMCDiagnostics Markov Chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics in Julia. Overview This package contains two very useful diagnostics for Markov Chain Monte Carlo: potential_scale_reduction(chains...) , which estimates the potential scale reduction factor, also known as Rhat , for multiple scalar chains, effective_sample_size(chain) , which calculates the effective sample size for scalar chains. These are intended as building blocks , to be used by other libraries, and were organized into a separate library for testing and DRY. Installation The package is registered. You can install it with Pkg . add ( " MCMCDiagnostics " ) Related You may find my other packages for MCMC interesting. See the documentation of DynamicHMC.jl for details.
