An R interface of Julia. It is based one the work of Rif and RJulia . Since the development of Rif has been slowed down and I wanted to learn more about the Julia and R, I started this project. This package was named RCall.jl . However a more promising package RCall.jl is now alive at JuliaStats, I have renamed this to RCalling.jl . Installation Make sure you have Julia and R installed and their locations are in the PATH variable. You are eithing using a binary distribution of Julia or a "make install" distribution. Pkg.clone("https://github.com/randy3k/RCalling.jl.git") Pkg.build("RCalling") Developed on Mac OSX 10.10, R 3.1.2, Julia 0.3.2 Demo General usage Credits lgautier and armgong .
