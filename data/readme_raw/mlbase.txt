MLBase.jl Swiss knife for machine learning. This package does not implement specific machine learning algorithms. Instead, it provides a collection of useful tools to support machine learning programs, including: Data manipulation & preprocessing Score-based classification Performance evaluation ( e.g. evaluating ROC) Cross validation Model tuning ( i.e. search best settings of parameters) Notes: This package depends on StatsBase and reexports all names therefrom.
