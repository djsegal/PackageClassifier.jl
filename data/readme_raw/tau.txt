Tau.jl This Julia package defines the Tau constant and related functions. tau ≈ 2*pi Usage After installing this package with Pkg.add("Tau") , it can be used as follows: using Tau tau == τ ≈ 2 * pi # => true typeof (tau) # => Irrational{:τ} Note: to input the τ character, type \tau then press Tab . The tau variants of sinpi , cospi , and mod2pi are also defined: sintau ( 1 // 4 ) # => 1.0 costau ( 1 // 2 ) # => -1.0 The tau != 2pi inequality When this package was first created, the equality tau == 2pi did hold true, in accordance to the mathematical definition of the constant. However, that is not valid anymore -- the two values are only approximately equal: tau ≈ 2*pi . For a detailed explanation of the reasons for this, see this document .
