Polyhedra Documentation Build Status Social References to cite Polyhedra provides an unified interface for Polyhedral Computation Libraries such as CDDLib.jl . These manipulation notably include the transformation from (resp. to) an inequality representation of a polyhedron to (resp. from) its generator representation (convex hull of points + conic hull of rays) and projection/elimination of a variable with e.g. Fourier-Motzkin . It defines the abstract type Polyhedron and splits the operations on this type in two categories: Mandatory: Operations that needs to be implemented by the Polyhedral Computation Libraries: e.g. Transformation between the two representations described above and variable elimination. Optional: Operations that can be implemented using the other operations and hence have a default implementation: e.g. creation of the polyhedron from the feasible set of a JuMP model, linear transformation, intersection, Minkowski addition , decomposition into points and faces for e.g. 3D visualization using DrakeVisualizer or GLVisualize.jl ...
