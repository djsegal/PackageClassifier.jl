RunLengthArrays This Julia package implements a RunLengthArray{N,T} type that behaves like a 1D array but is extremely efficient if there are several repeating instances of a few values, like in the following example: using RunLengthArrays x = RunLengthArray {Int,String} ([ " X " , " X " , " X " , " X " , " O " , " O " , " O " , " O " , " O " ]) More information is available in the documentation.
