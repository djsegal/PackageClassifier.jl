OBC An optimal Bayesian classification library and runtime for RNA-Seq data. Installation Instructions Install the latest release of Julia Start a Julia terminal and run the following commands: Pkg . update () Pkg . clone ( " git://github.com/binarybana/OBC.jl.git " ) Usage You are now ready to use the OBC Julia library. The core operations look something like the following, using OBC data1,data2 = ... # your datasets as integer valued matrices (samples x genes) d1,d2 = ... # the normalization factors for each dataset (float arrays) cls = MPM . mpm_classifier (data1, data2, d1 = d1, d2 = d2) MPM . sample (cls, 10000 ) bemc = MPM . bee_e_mc (cls, ( mean (d1), mean (d2))) For a full example (with code to generate synthetic data) see the run.jl runner script.
