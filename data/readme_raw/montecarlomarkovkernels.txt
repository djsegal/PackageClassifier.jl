Monte Carlo Markov Kernels This package provides some simple Monte Carlo Markov kernel implementations. Currently implemented: Random walk Metropolis Adaptive Metropolis To be implemented in the future: Metropolis-adjusted Langevin Hamiltonian Monte Carlo The package also provides implementations of some consistent asymptotic variance estimators: Batch means Spectral variance
