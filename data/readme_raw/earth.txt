Earth This is a wrapper for the stand-alone version of R's earth package. Installing Pkg.clone("git@github.com:lendle/Earth.jl.git") Pkg.build("Earth") Usage Ijulia notebook example earth function Returns an object of type EarthFit Arguments x::VecOrMat{Float64} - Vector or matrix of predictors. size(x, 1) is number of observations. size(x, 2) is number of predictors. y::VecOrMat{Float64} - Vector or matrix of outcomes. size(y, 1) is number of observations. size(y, 2) is number of outcomes. WeightsArg = ones(size(x, 1)) - Vector of observation weights. Comments in the C code indicate that this may not do anything. nMaxDegree = 1 - Maximum degree of interactions. nMaxTerms = min(200, max(20, 2 * size(x, 2))) + 1 - Maximum number of model terms before pruning. Penalty = (nMaxDegree > 1)? 3.0: 2.0 - Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) penalty per knot. Thresh = 0.001 - Forward stepping threshold. nMinSpan = 0 - Minimum distance between knots. Prune = true - Perform backwards pass? nFastK = 20 - Maximum number of parent terms considered at each step of the forward pass. FastBeta = 0.0 - Fast MARS aging coefficient, as described in the Fast MARS paper section 3.1. NewVarPenalty = 0.0 - Penalty for adding a new variable in the forward pass. LinPreds=zeros(Int32, size(x, 2)) - Index vector specifying which predictors should enter linearly, as in linear regression. This does not say that a predictor must enter the model; only that if it enters, it enters linearly. UseBetaCache = false - Using the “beta cache” takes more memory but is faster (by 20% and often much more for large models). Trace = 0.0 - Set to higher values (up to 5.0?) for increasingly verbose output. Set to special value 1.5 for information about memory allocations. See the documentation and vignette from the R package for details on the optional arguments, which may have slightly different names. predict function Returns a matrix of predicted outcomes with one row per observation and one column per outcome variable. Arguments ef::EarthFit - fitted earth object. x::VecOrMat{Float64} - Vector or matrix of (possibly new) predictors. modelmatrix function Given a vector or matrix of (possibly new) predictors, returns a matrix of MARS terms with a constant term in the first column. Arguments ef::EarthFit - fitted earth object. x::VecOrMat{Float64} - Vector or matrix of (possibly new) predictors.
