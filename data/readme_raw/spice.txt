SPICE.jl Julia wrapper for NASA NAIF's SPICE toolkit SPICE.jl is a Julia wrapper for the SPICE toolkit which is provided by NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF). It provides functionality to read SPICE data files and compute derived observation geometry such as altitude, latitude/longitude and lighting angles. Please refer to its comprehensive documentation if you are not yet familiar with SPICE. Note: This project is not affiliated with NASA, NAIF or JPL in any way.
