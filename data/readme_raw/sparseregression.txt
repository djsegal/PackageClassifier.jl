SparseRegression Documentation Master Build Test Coverage This package relies on primitives defined in the JuliaML ecosystem to implement high-performance algorithms for linear models which often produce sparsity in the coefficients. Quickstart using Pkg Pkg . add ( " SparseRegression " ) using SparseRegression x = randn ( 10_000 , 50 ) y = x * range ( - 1 , stop = 1 , length = 50 ) + randn ( 10_000 ) s = SModel (x, y, L2DistLoss (), L2Penalty ()) @time learn!
