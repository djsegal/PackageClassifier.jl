Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) This package provides basic implementations of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) for Julia 1.0. What is implemented The package currently contains the following implementations: Gamma HSIC (HSIC with Gamma approximation) [1] Example The gamma HSIC can be run using: X = randn ( 1 , 100 ) # rows are samples Y = randn ( 1 , 100 ) * 0.2 # rows are samples p = 0.1 # p-value (level of test) (value, threshold) = gammaHSIC (X, Y, Î± = p) independent = value < threshold Reference [1] Gretton, Arthur, et al.
