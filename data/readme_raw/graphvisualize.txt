GraphVisualize Graph visualization using GLVisualize.jl by Simon Danisch. Tightly integrated with LightGraphs.jl . This is a pre-alpha version. Install Pkg . clone ( " https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphVisualize.jl " ) Pkg . checkout ( " GLVisualize " ) Pkg . checkout ( " GLAbstraction " ) Usage For the time being only the function plot (g :: Graph ; observe = false ) returning an plot object of graph g and visualizing it in an OpenGL window. Is observe=true updates to g will be reflected in updates to the plot. You can left-click and drag a vertex to move it around. using LightGraphs using GraphVisualize g = erdos_renyi ( 10 , 20 ) plt = plot (g, observe = true ) # a windows pops up displaying g add_edge! (g, 3 , 7 ) # the plot is updated rem_edge! (g, 3 , 7 ) # the plot is updated rem_vertex! (g, 3 ) # the plot is updated add_vertex! (g) # the plot is updated # have fun moving the vertex around # now close the window g = WheelGraph ( 10 ) # create a new graph, DON'T ever plot twice the same graph plt = plot (g, observe = false ) # a windows pops up displaying g add_edge! (g, 3 , 7 ) # the plot is NOT updated push! (obs, g) # the plot is updated ...
