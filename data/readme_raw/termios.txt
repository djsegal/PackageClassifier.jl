TERMIOS This package provides an interface to the POSIX calls for tty I/O control. The termios functions describe a general terminal interface that is provided to control asynchronous communications ports. For a complete description of these calls, see the termios(3) manual page. All functions in this package take a RawFD file descriptor fd as their first argument. This can also be an integer file descriptor or a concrete instance of Base.LibuvStream , such as stdin or stdout . This package defines the constants needed to work with the functions provided. You may need to refer to your system documentation for more information on using this package.
