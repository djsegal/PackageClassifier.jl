Images.jl An open-source image processing library for Julia . Project organization Images.jl is increasingly becoming an "umbrella package" that bundles and re-exports other packages. Most of these packages are hosted at JuliaImages , JuliaArrays , JuliaGraphics , and JuliaMath . Contributing See CONTRIBUTING.md for details on how to get started contributing to JuliaImages. We are a welcoming and supportive community made up of volunteer developers. All participants are expected to abide by the Julia Community Standards . Credits Elements of this package descend from "image.jl" that once lived in Julia's extras/ directory. That file had several authors, of which the primary were Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Kroboth, Tim Holy, Mike Nolta, and Stefan Karpinski. This repository has been quite heavily reworked; please see the "contributors" tab above and on many of the other repositories at JuliaImages and elsewhere. Stargazers over time
