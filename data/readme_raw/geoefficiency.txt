Project Status: Author Mohamed E. Krar ( DrKrar@gmail.com ) Repository GitHub.com Documentation GitHub.io Current version v"0.9.4-dev" First Created Fri Aug 14 20:12:01 2015 Build status: Code coverage: GeoEfficiency: Accurate Geometrical Efficiency Calculator An officially registered Julia program, provides a set of tools to calculate the geometrical efficiency in a fast and accurate way. The Package models a radiation detector irradiated by a radioactive source. The Package relay directly on numerical evaluation of a closed form analytical formula describing the geometrical efficiency. Current/Planned Features The following list describe the state of current feature and planed feature. The checked items represent already present feature. support of widely used detector geometries. cylinder detectors. bore-hole detectors. well-type detectors. support of specialized detector geometries. support of isotropic radioactive sources. point sources. disc sources. cylinder sources. support of anisotropic radioactive sources. point sources. consider more details of the measurement setup. the detector effect. the end cap effect. the medium and absorber effect. combine the effect of the source geometry and composition. Requirements Julia 1.1 or above. QuadGK 2.0 or above, installed automatically during the package installation. Download/Installation Getting the GeoEfficiency package to work involves two steps: 1. Installing Julia Language Just head over to the Julia language download page and choose the suitable binary for your platform to download and install. At the end of this step you should be able to run julia from your system. Note Head to JuliaBox.com to run julia in your browser without any local installation. 2. Installing Package GeoEfficiency is registered officially and so the latest stable release can be installed through the Julia package management system just by typing the following into the julia REPL prompt. julia > import Pkg julia > Pkg . add ( " GeoEfficiency " ) Quick Usage After installing the package, you can load it to your current workspace by typing the following: julia > using GeoEfficiency Now the package is available to use, try typing: julia > calc () see also: geoEff() , calcN() , batch() Unit Test Being error free and accuracy is a highly demanded objective in scientific calculation. Thus, the package is extensively tested method-wise in each supported operating system. Operating system fully supported includes Windows, Linus, Apple OSX. After installing, the package can be tested in your own system by typing the following into the REPL prompt. julia > using Test, Pkg julia > Pkg . test ( " GeoEfficiency " ) Package Overview The following constructor can be used to construct a specific type of detector CylDetector for cylindrical detector, BoreDetector for bore hole, WellDetector for well type detector. While the function Detector can be used to construct any of the above types. You may try also getDetectors . Point constructor is used to construct an anchoring point of a source. relative to source anchoring point the source position is specified. For a point source, the anchoring point is the source itself. The source() method take input from the console and return a tuple describing the source. The efficiency calculation can be done by one of the functions: geoEff used with or without argument(s), calc ask for the required information from the console , calcN just a repeat of the calc function batch() which try to take required information from csv files located in the home directory inside a folder called GeoEfficiency . For more on the function and its methods prefix the name of the function by ? . Note Input from the console can be numerical expression not just a number. 5/2 ; 5//2 ; pi ; Ï€/2 ; exp(2) ; 1E-2 ; 5.2/3 ; sin(1) ; sin(1)^2 All are valid expressions. Batch Calculation The package can be used to perform batch calculations by calling one of the methods of the function batch . The output results of batch calculations is found by default in GeoEfficiency\results folder inside the user home directory. For example c:\users\yourusername\GeoEfficiency\results\ . The function batch() can be called with or without arrangement(s). The without argument version relay on previously prepared Comma Saved Values [CSV] files, that can be easily edit by Microsoft Excel, located by default in the GeoEfficiency folder. Those Comma Saved Values [CSV] files are:- Detectors.csv contains the detectors description ( a detector per line ); The line format is: Crystal_Radius Crystal_Length Hole_Radius Hole_Depth srcHeights.csv contains the source heights; Source_Heights srcRhos.csv contains the source off-axis distances; Source_Rhos srcRadii.csv contains the source radii for disc and cylindrical sources; Source_Radii srcLengths.csv contains the source length for cylindrical sources; Source_Lengths Note For Comma Saved Values [CSV] files each line represent an entry, the first line is always treated as the header. warning The program expect each line to contain one number for all CSV files except for Detectors.csv each line should contain at least one number or at most four separated numbers.
